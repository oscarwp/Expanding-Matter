# The Theory of Expanding Matter (TEM)

This is the working corpus for TEM. Start with **Manuscripts**, keep detailed derivations in **Proofs**, and maintain shared terms in **Glossary**.

## Math

Inline math: `\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)` → \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)  
Display math:
\[
  \nabla_v^2 = \tfrac{1}{5}\,\nabla^2
\]
