# Proofs

This folder stores detailed derivations and formal proofs referenced by manuscripts.

- `Proofs-Only.md` — a catch‑all file you can split later
- Add one file per theorem/lemma when it grows large
- Cross‑link back to the citing manuscript

**Template**
See `../Templates/TEMPLATE_Proof.md` for a structured proof layout.
