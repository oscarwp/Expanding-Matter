### Abstract

We present Torsional Cosmogenesis (TC) as the mechanical interpretation of the Theory of Expanding Matter (TEM). TC describes how the continuous expansion of the universal plenum manifests as tangible physical structures. We posit that structure arises from the torsional locking of density waves into stable, pressure-locked spheres. This mechanism provides a physical realization of the Harmonic Fixed-Point Theorem, where stability (rational VCR) corresponds to the closure of torsional loops at critical pressure thresholds generated by expansion. We demonstrate how the 14 configurations of the Rational Resonance Radix correspond to these stable mechanical packings. This framework provides intuitive mechanical explanations for fundamental phenomena: charge as exposed geometric frustration, chemistry as frustration minimization, the definition of the Quark (N=29 helix), and the distinction between baryons (N=89 Neutron vs. N=90 Proton) based on the closure pressure threshold.

### 1. Introduction

The Theory of Expanding Matter [Paper 2] established the architecture of reality based on the management of expansion via Geometric Constraint Satisfaction (GCS). Torsional Cosmogenesis (TC) provides the necessary mechanical interpretation, describing _how_ expansion pressure drives the formation of matter.

TC asserts that the universe is a continuous plenum, and all phenomena emerge from its geometric organization under expansion pressure. The fundamental mechanism is **torsional locking**.

### 2. The Plenum, Expansion, and Torsion

#### 2.1 The Continuous Plenum and Expansion

We reject the notion of a vacuum. All physical existence is a reorganization of a single continuous medium (the plenum). The fundamental driver of all phenomena is the continuous expansion of this plenum.

#### 2.2 Torsion as Motion

Expansion pressure creates gradients in the plenum density. These gradients do not propagate linearly but twist. Motion is fundamentally **torsional pressure waves**. This is the mechanical realization of the drive to preserve the Volumetric Cross-Ratio (VCR) during expansion.

#### 2.3 The Formation of Structure

Structure arises when these torsional waves close upon themselves.

**Definition 2.1 (Fundamental Unit):** A fundamental unit ("ball") represents a region of the plenum where torsional oscillations have achieved closure, forming a stable, pressure-locked sphere. These units are identical at their scale seat.

### 3. Torsional Locking and Stability

The Harmonic Fixed-Point Theorem (HFPT) states that stability requires a rational VCR. TC provides the mechanical realization.

#### 3.1 Pressure Thresholds

Expansion drives compression. Stability is achieved when compression exceeds a critical value, causing the torsional loops to "lock."

**The Mechanism of Cosmogenesis:**

1. **Expansion/Compression:** Local pressure rises.
    
2. **Torsion:** Density waves curl into helical filaments.
    
3. **Interlock and Closure:** Filaments converge and lock.
    
4. **Relief:** The new stable sphere forms.
    

#### 3.2 The Radix as Stable Packings

The 14 stable configurations of the Rational Resonance Radix (RRR) correspond exactly to the configurations of identical units that can lock without internal voids under pressure. A rational VCR is the mathematical signature of perfect mechanical closure.

### 4. The Structure of Elementary Particles

TC provides specific mechanical interpretations for the structure of matter based on the Radix configurations.

#### 4.1 The Quark Basis (N=29)

The Radix position N=29 corresponds to the fundamental **helical chain** structure. This configuration is characterized by inherent chirality and torsional dynamics.

In TC, quarks are rigorously defined as dynamic structures based on the N=29 helix. This is the fundamental building block for baryons.

#### 4.2 The Baryon Threshold (N=89 $\leftrightarrow$ N=90)

The formation of stable baryons occurs at the critical threshold involving the N=90 symmetry reset.

**The Formation Sequence:** Three N=29 helical structures intertwine ($3 \times 29 \approx 90$). The resulting stability depends on the ambient pressure generated by expansion relative to the closure threshold ($P_{threshold}$).

**The Proton (N=90):** If ambient pressure $P \ge P_{threshold}$, the structure achieves full closure. This is the fully locked, dense sphere.

**The Neutron (N=89):** If ambient pressure $P < P_{threshold}$, one inclusion fails to lock. This results in N=89, an under-compressed, slightly larger configuration.

### 5. Frustration, Charge, and Chemistry

#### 5.1 Charge as Geometric Frustration

If a configuration has an open port or an uncompensated geometric stub, the structure is **frustrated**.

**Definition 5.1 (Charge):** Charge is the manifestation of exposed geometric frustration vectors.

#### 5.2 Chemistry as Frustration Minimization

Chemical behavior is the drive to minimize this geometric frustration. Bonding is the geometric interlock between adjacent structures that cancels mutual frustration.

### 6. Recursive Structure and Plasma

The TC mechanism is recursive across all scales (Scale Seats).

**Definition 6.1 (Plasma):** Plasma is plenum whose local torsional pressure is below the stability threshold required for the formation of stable matter (N=89/90). Plasma is "unlocked plenum," consisting of fragments (e.g., N=29 helices) and characterized by exposed frustration (charge) and torsional flicker (radiation).

### 7. Conclusion

Torsional Cosmogenesis provides the mechanical interpretation of the TEM framework. It translates the abstract mathematics into tangible physical mechanisms driven by expansion pressure: torsional locking, pressure thresholds, and geometric frustration, offering a unified, intuitive model for matter formation and interaction.
