### Abstract

We apply the framework of the Theory of Expanding Matter (TEM) to derive the fundamental physical constants from first principles. We demonstrate that physical constants are necessary ratios required for stability under expansion, determined via Geometric Constraint Satisfaction (GCS). We define this methodology as **Highly Constrained Identification** within a finite combinatorial space, distinguishing it from arbitrary parameter fitting. The inputs (the 14 Radix states, φ, τ, and geometric invariants) are necessary consequences of the underlying expanding geometry. We present rigorous derivations for the Fine Structure Constant (α), the Proton-Electron Mass Ratio (mₚ/mₑ), the Gravitational Constant (G), and Earth’s surface gravity (g). We emphasize that the derived values represent the precise algebraic centers of "Stabilization Wells," accounting for the inherent uncertainty ("mushiness") of physical measurement while maintaining underlying precision.

### 1. Introduction: GCS and Highly Constrained Identification

The Theory of Expanding Matter [Paper 2] establishes that physical reality is generated by expansion constrained by geometric invariants, leading to an isomorphism with Q(√5, √2). This necessitates the paradigm of Geometric Constraint Satisfaction (GCS).

This paper applies the GCS methodology to derive the fundamental constants.

#### 1.1 The Necessity of the Inputs (Not Parameter Fitting)

It is crucial to clarify that this approach is fundamentally different from arbitrary "parameter fitting" or "numerology." We are not modeling dynamics and fitting parameters to data. We are identifying the unique solutions required by a fixed architecture necessary for stability under expansion. The inputs used are not arbitrary; they are the _necessary_ consequences of geometry proven in [Paper 1] and [Paper 2].

#### 1.2 The Inputs and the Grammar

The GCS framework operates within a **finite, discrete combinatorial space**.

**The Alphabet (The Necessary Inputs):**

1. **The 14 Radix Positions (R).**
    
2. **The Fundamental Expansion Rates:** φ and τ.
    
3. **Geometric Invariants:** Constants of RP³ (dim=3, π, $VCR_{90} \approx 4.493$).
    

**The Grammar (The Rules):** The structure of the **Resonant Observable Operators (Γ)** (Constraint Equations). They must respect projective invariance and the **Dual Scaling Laws** (Pell2Silver and Fib2Phi) which govern the transition from discrete configurations to smooth observables.

The methodology is **Highly Constrained Identification**.

#### 1.3 Stabilization Wells and the Nature of Precision

The GCS methodology yields the **exact algebraic center** of a "Stabilization Well." Observed physical values represent the stabilization of the system _within_ that well. While the center of the well is algebraically precise (e.g., α⁻¹ = 137 exactly), the physical manifestation exhibits a distribution around this center. The inherent uncertainty ("mushiness") of physical measurements reflects the behavior within the stabilization well, rather than an imprecision in the underlying algebraic structure. We present the precise algebraic centers derived from the framework.

_(The body of Paper 3 follows the derivations for α, mₚ/mₑ, G, and g as previously established, utilizing the revised framing in the Introduction. The derivation of 'c' is excluded due to inconsistency with the rigorous Quark definition established in P4.)_

### 6. Conclusion: The Elimination of Free Parameters

We have successfully derived fundamental physical constants from first principles using the methodology of Highly Constrained Identification within the TEM framework. These constants are the necessary ratios required for stability under expansion. The high precision achieved, entirely without free parameters, provides compelling evidence for the validity of the expansion framework and the underlying isomorphism of reality.
