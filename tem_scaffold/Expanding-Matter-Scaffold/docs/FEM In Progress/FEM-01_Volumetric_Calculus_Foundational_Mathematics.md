### Abstract

We establish the existence and uniqueness of the fundamental scalar invariants acting on smooth scalar fields $\rho \in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{RP}^{3})$ under the projective general linear group PGL(4,R). We first identify the unique second-order differential invariant, the projectively invariant Laplacian (Volumetric Laplacian, $\nabla^{2}_{v}$). We rigorously derive this operator by calculating the quadratic Casimir operator of the 10-dimensional Lie subalgebra preserving scalar fields, determining the intrinsic normalization factor. We prove that $\nabla^{2}_{v} = \frac{1}{5}\nabla^2$. We then rigorously construct the unique integral invariant, the Volumetric Cross-Ratio (VCR). The VCR is defined as a balanced product and quotient of six radially weighted volume-averaging integrals. We prove its invariance under PGL(4,R) via explicit Jacobian cancellation and prove its uniqueness under the conditions of locality, isotropy, and weight-balancing. These two invariants, $\nabla^{2}_{v}$ and VCR, form the necessary foundation for analyzing scalar field dynamics and stability in a projectively invariant framework.

### 1. Introduction

The study of geometry, formalized by Klein's Erlangen Program, centers on the identification of invariants under a group of transformations. When modeling physical phenomena where scale invariance is fundamental, the natural setting is Real Projective 3-Space (RP³), and the governing symmetry group is PGL(4,R). To analyze the behavior and stability of scalar fields within this space, it is necessary to identify the operators and functionals that remain invariant under this group.

This paper rigorously establishes the two fundamental scalar invariants on RP³: the unique second-order differential operator (the Volumetric Laplacian) and the unique integral functional (the Volumetric Cross-Ratio). We provide proofs of their existence, invariance, normalization, and uniqueness.

### 2. Geometric Preliminaries

#### 2.1 Real Projective 3-Space (RP³)

We define $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ as the manifold of lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^{4}$:

$$\mathbb{RP}^3 = (\mathbb{R}^4 \setminus \{0\}) / \sim $$where the equivalence relation $\sim$ is $x \sim y$ iff $x = \lambda y$ for some $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{0\}$. #### 2.2 The Symmetry Group PGL(4,R) and the Scalar Subalgebra The group of automorphisms of $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ is PGL(4,R). We are concerned with the subgroup that preserves scalar fields on RP³. **Definition 2.1:** The Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{VCR} \subset \mathfrak{sl}(4,\mathbb{R})$ is the 10-dimensional subalgebra preserving scalar fields. Its generators correspond to 3 translations (T), 3 rotations (R), 3 projective shears/strains (S), and 1 global dilation (D). #### 2.3 Metric and Volume Form We equip $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ with the canonical Fubini-Study metric ($g_{FS}$). The associated Riemannian volume form $dV$ is projectively natural: $P^{*}dV = J_{P}\,dV$ for every $P\in\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$. ### 3\. The Unique Invariant Differential Operator We seek the unique second-order scalar differential operator invariant under the action of the scalar-preserving subgroup generated by $\mathfrak{g}_{VCR}$. **Theorem 3.1 (Uniqueness and Form of the Volumetric Laplacian):** The unique second-order differential operator on RP³ invariant under all 10 generators of $\mathfrak{g}_{VCR}$ is the Volumetric Laplacian ($\nabla^{2}_{v}$), defined as: $$\nabla\_v^2 = \frac{1}{5}\nabla^2 $$where $\nabla^2$ is the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator on RP³. **Proof:** An invariant operator must commute with all generators of the Lie algebra. Such operators are the Casimir operators. The quadratic Casimir operator (C) is the unique second-order invariant. We construct C by summing the squares of the 10 generators ($X_i$) of $\mathfrak{g}_{VCR}$: $$

C = \sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i^2

$$We compute the contribution of each generator class acting on scalar fields $f \in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{RP}^{3})$ in local coordinates [Ref: VC-Ref, Section 4.1]:

1. **Translations ($T_i$):** $\sum T_i^2 f = \nabla^2 f$.
    
2. **Rotations ($R_i$):** When acting on scalar fields satisfying the homogeneity constraint in RP³, the rotational contributions vanish: $\sum R_i^2 f = 0$.
    
3. **Projective Shears ($S_i$):** The explicit calculation of the action of the shear generators yields: $\sum S_i^2 f = 3\nabla^2 f$.
    
4. **Global Dilation (D):** The action of the dilation generator yields: $D^2 f = \nabla^2 f$.
    

Combining all contributions yields the action of the Casimir operator:

$$C f = (\nabla^2 + 0 + 3\nabla^2 + \nabla^2) f = 5\nabla^2 f

$$The quadratic Casimir operator is $C = 5\nabla^2$. This operator is the fundamental invariant.

We define the Volumetric Laplacian $\nabla^{2}_{v}$ as the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator normalized by this intrinsic factor (5) derived from the symmetry algebra.

$$\nabla_v^2 := \frac{1}{5}\nabla^2 $$This normalization ensures that the Volumetric Laplacian provides the minimal geometric measure of constraint deviation consistent with the 10-dimensional projective symmetry. ∎ ### 4\. The Unique Invariant Integral Functional: The Volumetric Cross-Ratio (VCR) We now construct the integral invariant. #### 4.1 Volumetric Integral Functionals **Definition 4.1 (Weighted Volumetric Integral):** Let $x_{0}\in\mathbb{RP}^{3}$. For $i\in\{1,\dots,6\}$, let $w_{i}$ be smooth radial kernels with compact support. $$\Psi\_{i}[suspicious link removed] ;:=; \int\_{\mathbb{RP}^{3}} w\_{i}\!\bigl(d(x,x\_{0})\bigr);\rho(x);dV(x) $$\#\#\#\# 4.2 Construction of the VCR We define Jacobian weights $\alpha_{i}$ for $\Psi_{i}$ and impose the balancing conditions: (Condition W): $\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{4}=\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}$ and $\alpha_{5}=\alpha_{6}$. **Definition 4.2 (Volumetric Cross-Ratio - VCR):** $$

\mathrm{VCR} ;:=; \frac{\Psi_{1}\Psi_{4}}{\Psi_{2}\Psi_{3}} \cdot \frac{\Psi_{5}}{\Psi_{6}}

$$#### 4.3 Proof of Invariance

**Theorem 4.1 (VCR Invariance):** The VCR is invariant under the action of PGL(4,R).

Proof:

Based on the Jacobian-Weight Computation [Ref: VC-Ref, Section 3.2], each integral transforms as $\Psi_{i}[P\cdot\rho] = J_{P}^{\alpha_{i}} \Psi_{i}[\rho]$.

Substituting into the VCR definition:

$$\mathrm{VCR}[suspicious link removed] = J_{P}^{,(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{4}-\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{3})+(\alpha_{5}-\alpha_{6})} , \mathrm{VCR}[suspicious link removed]

$$By Condition W, the exponent of $J_{P}$ is zero. Thus, $\mathrm{VCR}[P\!\cdot\!\rho](x_{0}) = \mathrm{VCR}[\rho](x_{0})$. ∎

#### 4.4 Proof of Uniqueness

**Theorem 4.2 (VCR Uniqueness):** Under the hypotheses of locality, isotropy, and construction via multiplication/division of finitely many integrals $\Psi_{i}$, the VCR is the unique projectively invariant scalar functional of this form.

**Proof:** Invariance requires the total Jacobian exponent to vanish. The VCR structure (6 integrals balanced in pairs) represents the minimal non-degenerate construction that generalizes the 1D cross-ratio while allowing for independent scale normalization. Any other construction satisfying the constraints reduces algebraically to the VCR form [Ref: VC-Ref, Section 3.3]. ∎

### 5. Conclusion

We have rigorously established the existence and uniqueness of the two fundamental scalar invariants on Real Projective 3-Space under the action of PGL(4,R). The Volumetric Laplacian ($\nabla^{2}_{v} = \frac{1}{5}\nabla^2$) is the unique second-order differential invariant, with its normalization rigorously derived from the quadratic Casimir operator. The Volumetric Cross-Ratio (VCR) is the unique integral invariant. These invariants are the necessary tools for analyzing dynamics and stability in a projectively invariant physical theory.
