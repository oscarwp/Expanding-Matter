25-THOUGHT_EXPERIMENT_CONSOLIDATED

This stuff is really the way I came to understand all of this initially and it's still sound.  If this is worked into part of a release I'd have to figure out how to present it as this is not acceptable.  

Thought experiment breakdown:

1. Draw a circle and call it our universe.
   1.1 The audience describes what they observe: A circle.

2. Our universe is composed of nothing but this circle. It has a single property: It expands outward from the center.
   2.1 Audience can observe the circle getting larger.

3. Introduce a second circle adjacent to the first, also with the property of expansion.
   3.1 Audience observes the interaction between the two expanding circles.

4. Add more circles to the universe, each with the same expansion property.
   4.1 Audience witnesses the formation of a tightly packed, circular arrangement of expanding circles.

5. Increase the number of circles to a large, finite value, creating a densely packed circular universe.
   5.1 Audience observes the overall structure and shape of the expanding circle universe.

6. As the circles expand, the universe begins to curve and bend, deviating from its initial flat, circular shape.
   6.1 Audience contemplates the distortion and warping of the universe's geometry.

7. The curvature increases, causing the universe to intersect with itself and create regions of higher density.
   7.1 Audience zooms in to observe the localized effects of self-intersection and the concentration of expanding circles.

8. Over time, the repeated folding and intersection of the universe give rise to a complex, interconnected structure.
   8.1 Audience explores the emergence of distinct, gravitationally bound structures, such as planets and solar systems.

9. Zoom back in from the outside of the universe cosmic view but back to a 2D consideration of an area in our universe where the dynamic orgins have resulted in a planet being formed.  It is a 2D circle composed of the circles that make up our universe--however, they are more dense as a result of the earlier folding and bending of the universe.  So that resulted in this planet.  For the sake of our thought experiment lets say the planet is in the center of our universe. This planet represents an area of more densly packed circles than the rest of our universe--but the circles still have the same property as before: They are expanding.  Now lets put an observer circle on our planet.

10.  The observer exists at the same density as everything other than the more dense planet.  Now lets imagine what this user experinces.

11.  Let give the observer a special ability.  Our observer can pop adjacent bubbles.  The ability to pop adjacent bubbles causes a gap that all of the expanding circles, including the observers, need to fill as they expand.  And as a result nearly all of the universe has to adjust a little and our user gets to adjust and move a lot relative to most of the universe.  Our observer has achieved motion by popping bubble and we'll call the result of a bubble popping energy.  

12. Lets imagine our user creating some energy by popping bubbles around them.  They learn to move about through our universe--but what do they experience adjacent to the planet?  Can they get away from the planet by popping bubbles above them?  The audience should conclude that they can not because the planet is expanding much more quickly.  

Critical:  What would this feel like to our observer? We're looking for the audience to describe the sensation of being able to use energy to move around on the surface of the planet but if they pop circles above them the more rapid expansion of the adjacent more dense planet will continue to push against them.  How would this feel to them?  It may feel they like they are being pulled toward the planet.  Our observer would observe this.

13.  As a result our observer creates science for their universe.  They describe their experience moving around by creating energy and they describe their experience trying to move away from the planet.  To that end they observe other objects, let's say an 'apple' falling from a tree.  This might inspire them to give this observation of everything being compelled towards the planet a name, let's say they call it gravity, and they describe this gravity as a force.

The audience should discuss how it's perfectly logical that the observers science describes this as a force pulling---because they witness it over and over again.  But they also know that in this universe the mechanism behind what the observer experiences is expanding circles.  So our observer, has created a mathematically sound description for their understanding of gravity that works for nearly all of the observations they make in their local area of the universe.  

14.  Now lets add a massive star near the edge of our universe, distant from our centralized planet and observer.  Lets imagine our observer can look up and see that distant star at the edge of the universe.  From our observers perspective can you describe what they could conclude about that sun, considering that all of the matter between our observer and that sun is expanding?  They should come to the conclusion that they would witness the space between them and sun increasing and it would appear that the sun is moving away.  Indicating to our observer that the universe is expanding.  They would have to adapt their science for this, they may create a new way of understanding their universe now--it would describe that it was expanding but they would still observe no expansion in any given circle as the relative sizes of each remains the same.  What might they call this science?

15.  Now let there be light.  Let's attribute the ability to pop circles to our star as well.  Lets give our star a much more effective means of popping circles resulting in big chances to the circles near this star.  They must all fill in and ajust to accommodate the space and reduced expansion created as the circles are popped by our sun.  As they fill in the space one could think of this as grains of sand falling into a whole, as this happens there is a lot of movement, some is large, much is very small.  And this movement results in atoms fighting to fill the gaps and vibrating, as they adjust and settle and adjust and settle, causing the adjacent atoms to vibrate and those adjacent atoms to vibrate and the vibrations happen at a frequency that easily propogates through the circles surrounding our sun.  And those circles vibrate those adjacent circles all the way until all of the circles between our observer and our sun are vibrating and adjusting to fit in the gap--the very, very distant gap.  

Lets give our observer a retina that can pick up these very tiny vibrations.  They can view the nature iof the vibrations when they look at the source of the vibrations.  They observe light traveling in a straight line from the distant sun to their retina.  They attribute this light to energy as they recognize that when they pop bubbles to create their energy heat, similar that to what they feel from the distant sun is released. 

16. Lets add a massive planet.  This planet is half way between our observer and the sun but off to the side.  This massive planet is many times larger and more dense than the observers planet.  What would this area of more densely packed equally expanding matter result in?  They audience should observe that the light will bend around the planet as the long lines of vibration extending from the star to our observer will be impacted.

They will observe that gravity bends 'light' in their science.  But they will not be able to understand that it is all a result of the expansion and change of expansion of these circles.


The following is interesting but I don't love the characterization--this is from stuff that is over a year old so understanding has shifted---but this is all still good context.

This star is very dense and as a result it happens to have the same ability as our observer.  It can pop circles.  When the star pops circles all of the matter adjacent to it must adjust as well as the adjacent matter to that and so on.  In this adjustment the matter is in motion and as it all composed of standard sizes the way it fills the gaps being created by our sun popping circles it vibrates.  And the rate that it vibrates happens to propagate through our matter efficiently with matter vibrating from adjacent matter as our universe 

Another Take on the Thought Experiment:
The Thought Experiment
1.	The Universe Model: Expanding Circles
Starting Point: A 2D universe is composed of tightly packed, uniform circles arranged in a larger circular structure. These circles:
Are uniform in size.
Cannot overlap.
Expand uniformly outward from their centers, maintaining shape and adjacency.
2.	The Observer's Experience and Need for Explanation
Local Observations: An observer within this universe perceives their immediate surroundings as static since all circles, including their own, expand uniformly.
Distant Observations: When observing distant regions, the expansion becomes apparent, creating contradictions between local and distant observations.
Need for Explanations:
The observer develops theories to reconcile these observations, such as inventing concepts like "dark energy" to explain the apparent outward movement of distant circles.
These theories emerge from a fundamental misunderstanding: the observer does not realize that their own circle is expanding, influencing their perception of the universe.
3.	Emergent Geometry and Theoretical Complexity
Distortion of the Universe: As the circles expand, the overall shape of the universe distorts, which the observer interprets as an evolving cosmic structure.
Complicating Theories:
To account for the observed expansion and distortions, the observer may hypothesize invisible forces or fields, adding layers of complexity to their explanations.
These theories, while internally consistent, are increasingly convoluted as they attempt to reconcile local stability with distant expansion.
4.	Introducing Dense Regions (Planets)
Higher-Density Circles: Some regions consist of more densely packed circles (planets), which also expand equally.
Gravity Analogy:
Observers near these dense regions notice an apparent attraction to them, leading to the development of a gravitational theory.
However, this “gravity” is an emergent effect of the density-driven imbalance in expansion forces, not a fundamental force.
5.	Propagation of Vibrations (Light)
Light Waves: Vibrations travel through the circles to represent light. When passing near dense regions, these vibrations bend, mimicking gravitational lensing.
Theories of Light:
Observers attribute this bending to a gravitational field, further complicating their understanding of their universe’s fundamental mechanics.
6.	Scaling the Model to Atoms
Expanding Atoms: Extending the model to our universe, atoms replace circles, with properties such as:
Expansion proportional to atomic weight.
Creation of gravitational-like effects from denser atomic arrangements.
Complex Theoretical Layers:
The observer, unaware of atomic expansion, builds concepts like spacetime and quantum fields to describe interactions, layering these explanations on misunderstood phenomena.
7.	Overlapping Nature of Atoms
Infinite Overlap:
Atoms extend indefinitely and overlap, resolving issues such as electron probability and the apparent continuity of matter.
Observers misinterpret this overlap as probabilistic behavior, leading to quantum mechanics' counterintuitive explanations.
No Vacuum:
The concept of empty space (vacuum) is an illusion; the universe is entirely composed of expanding, overlapping matter.
8.	The Observer's Theoretical Spiral
Increasing Complexity:
Observers develop increasingly intricate models, such as quantum uncertainty and spacetime curvature, to reconcile observations at different scales.
These models are rooted in the failure to recognize the universe’s fundamental property: expansion.
Cumulative Confusion:
Each new observation (e.g., redshift, gravitational lensing, quantum entanglement) leads to further elaborations, creating a tangled web of theories that move farther from the simple truth of the universe's mechanics.
9.	Unified Theory: Expanding Matter
Key Assertions:
The universe is composed entirely of expanding matter.
Fields and forces are not fundamental but emergent from the interactions of expanding, overlapping matter.
Phenomena such as gravity, redshift, and quantum uncertainty are natural consequences of this expansion.
10.	Observational Limitations and Insights
Local vs. Global Observations:
Observers’ theories become more accurate when considering distant phenomena (e.g., redshift) because the expansion’s effects dominate.
Locally, their theories fail because they cannot account for their own expansion and its impact on measurements.
Matter-Time: Time is redefined as a relative measure of the size and location of expanding matter, explaining its apparent flow and irreversibility.
