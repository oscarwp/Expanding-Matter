# Topological and Projective Properties of Real Projective 3‑Space (RP³)

## Introduction

Real projective 3-space, denoted $\mathbb{RP}^3$, is the space of all lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Equivalently, it can be constructed by taking the 3-sphere $S^3$ and identifying each point with its antipodal point (the point directly opposite on $S^3$) ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=a%20%E2%81%A0%5BImage%2010%3A%20,n%2B1)). This construction endows $\mathbb{RP}^3$ with a rich topological structure: it is a **compact** 3-dimensional manifold without boundary ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20%2C%20real%20projective,of%20a%20%2061%20space)). Intuitively, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ represents a _closed universe_ in which moving in a "straight line" will eventually loop back to the starting point. In projective geometry terms, parallel directions are identified as a single "point at infinity," so the space has no edges or external boundary.

In this paper, we explore fundamental topological and geometric properties of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ with full mathematical rigor. We begin by formally defining $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and proving its compactness via the antipodal identification on $S^3$. We then investigate the **cyclic nature** of $\mathbb{RP}^3$, showing that every "line" in projective 3-space is homeomorphic to a circle — a striking result that implies any straight path in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ closes on itself. Next, we introduce **generalized cross-ratios** in three-dimensional projective geometry. In particular, we define _volume cross-ratios_ for configurations of points in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and prove these ratios remain invariant under all projective transformations. These invariants generalize the classical cross-ratio of four collinear points (in $\mathbb{RP}^1$) to higher-dimensional incidence configurations. We then discuss the role of **projective transformations** in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, emphasizing how they preserve incidence structures (such as collinearity and coplanarity) and how the projective treatment of "points at infinity" yields a coherent, closed-loop structure for space. Throughout, we provide formal definitions, theorems, and proofs, as well as intuitive analogies to aid understanding.

By the end of this paper, the reader will see clearly why $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a self-contained 3D manifold (compact and without boundary), why every projective line in it is a loop (circle), how cross-ratios can be extended to 3D and used as projective invariants, and how projective transformations govern the geometry of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ by effectively "gluing" infinity into the fabric of space. We aim to maintain a high level of mathematical rigor befitting a journal article, while also providing insights and analogies to make the abstract concepts more intuitive.

## Topology of $\mathbb{RP}^3$: Construction and Closure

**Definition (Real Projective 3-Space).** The _real projective 3-space_ $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is defined as the set of all lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Formally,

RP3={lines through 0∈R4}=(R4∖{0})/∼,\mathbb{RP}^3 = \{\text{lines through }0 \in \mathbb{R}^4\} = (\mathbb{R}^4 \setminus \{0\})/\sim,

where $v \sim \lambda v$ for any nonzero real scalar $\lambda$ (two nonzero vectors are equivalent if one is a nonzero scalar multiple of the other) ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=As%20with%20all%20projective%20spaces,by%20identifying%20%2069%20of)). Equivalently, one may take the unit 3-sphere $S^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ and identify each point $x \in S^3$ with its antipodal point $-x$; the resulting quotient space is $\mathbb{RP}^3$ ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=a%20%E2%81%A0%5BImage%2010%3A%20,n%2B1)).

**Theorem 1 (Compactness and Closedness of $\mathbb{RP}^3$).** Real projective 3-space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a _closed_ topological manifold of dimension 3. In particular, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is compact, and it has no boundary.

**Proof:** To show $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is compact, we use the fact that $S^3$ (the 3-sphere in $\mathbb{R}^4$) is a compact set. The natural projection $\pi: S^3 \to \mathbb{RP}^3$ sending $x \in S^3$ to its antipodal equivalence class $[x]$ is continuous and surjective. Since $S^3$ is compact, the image of $S^3$ under a continuous map is also compact. Thus $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is compact ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20%2C%20real%20projective,of%20a%20%2061%20space)). Another intuitive argument is that one can represent $\mathbb{RP}^3$ as a closed 3-ball $D^3$ (which is compact) with antipodal points on the boundary 2-sphere $S^2$ identified ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=One%20can%20further%20restrict%20to,1%7D%7D%5D%2C%20identified)). Identifying boundary points does not introduce any "leaks" or non-compact behavior; it merely glues edges together, preserving compactness.

To see that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has no boundary, note that locally (around any point), $\mathbb{RP}^3$ resembles Euclidean 3-space. More rigorously, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ can be given the structure of a smooth manifold (in fact, a real-analytic one) of dimension 3 ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=In%20mathematics%20%2C%20real%20projective,of%20a%20%2061%20space)). In a manifold, "no boundary" means every local neighborhood is homeomorphic to an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$, not a half-ball. In the construction via $D^3$ with antipodal boundary identification, the boundary $S^2$ of the ball is not a boundary in the projective space, because each boundary point is identified with another — effectively, the boundary $S^2$ _ceases to exist as a boundary_ and becomes an internal part of the space. Thus $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a closed (compact and boundaryless) 3-manifold.

_Remark:_ The closed nature of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ implies a striking fact: the space is **finite yet unbounded**. There are no "edge points" or boundaries where the space ends; any attempt to exit the space brings you back inside due to the identification. Topologically, this is akin to how the 2-sphere $S^2$ is a finite surface without edges — except that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has a more subtle structure (for instance, it is non-simply-connected with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fundamental group, reflecting the antipodal identification). For our purposes, the key takeaway is that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a self-contained 3D universe: it is compact (of finite volume, if one were to define a volume form) and has no boundary to spill out of.

**Analogy (Antipodal Identification Model):** One way to visualize $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is to start with a solid ball (imagine a planet or a closed sphere filled with space) and then **identify** or "glue together" opposite points on the surface of that ball. If a traveler in this space heads straight toward the boundary, they re-emerge from the opposite side of the ball. This is analogous to certain video games where exiting the screen on the right makes your character reappear on the left, except in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ the _entire spherical boundary_ is identified in pairs. There is no physical boundary anymore — trying to leave the space just loops you around. Thus, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ can be thought of as a **3D Pac-Man world**, but with the important twist that the "wrap-around" identification pairs opposite points (rotated 180° from each other). As a result, a full $360^\circ$ trip in one direction leads you to the same location, but possibly with a flipped orientation (a subtlety related to the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ identification). This finite yet edgeless nature of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a hallmark of its topology.

## Cyclic Nature of $\mathbb{RP}^3$: Lines as Circles

A fundamental consequence of the projective construction is that **every straight line in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a closed loop**. In fact, as we will prove, each line is homeomorphic to a circle. Here by "line" we mean a _projective line_, i.e. the image of a 2-dimensional linear subspace of $\mathbb{R}^4$ under the quotient map. Equivalently, a projective line in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is the set of all points in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ lying along a single 1-dimensional projective subspace (isomorphic to $\mathbb{RP}^1$).

**Proposition 2 (Projective Lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ are Circles).** Any projective line in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is homeomorphic to $S^1$ (a circle). In particular, the real projective line $\mathbb{RP}^1$, which is the simplest example of a projective line, is topologically a circle ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=,Image%2025)).

**Proof:** Let $\ell$ be a projective line in $\mathbb{RP}^3$. By definition, $\ell$ consists of all points of the form $[v]$ where $v$ is a nonzero vector lying in some 2-dimensional subspace $V \subset \mathbb{R}^4$. Choose a basis for $V$ and identify $V$ (which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$) with $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then $\ell$ is (by definition of projectivization) the projective space of $V$, i.e. $\ell \cong \mathbb{P}(V) = \mathbb{RP}^1$. It is a standard fact that $\mathbb{RP}^1$ is homeomorphic to a circle ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=,Image%2025)). For completeness, we outline that fact: $\mathbb{RP}^1$ can be seen as the set of lines through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^2$. If we take the unit circle $S^1 \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, each line through the origin intersects $S^1$ in two antipodal points; identifying those antipodal points on $S^1$ produces a space homeomorphic to $S^1$ itself (in fact, $S^1$ with opposite points identified is again a circle). Concretely, one can parameterize $S^1$ by an angle $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$, and the identification $\theta \sim \theta+\pi$ (antipodal) yields a circle of circumference $\pi$; this is just a relabeled circle. Therefore $\mathbb{RP}^1 \cong S^1$. It follows that $\ell$, being isomorphic to $\mathbb{RP}^1$, is also a circle.

Another way to see this within $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is to use the $S^3$ model. A projective line $\ell \subset \mathbb{RP}^3$ lifts to a great circle on $S^3$ (since $\ell$ corresponds to a 2D plane through the origin in $\mathbb{R}^4$, the intersection of that plane with the unit $S^3$ is a circle $S^1$). The antipodal identification on $S^3$ might at first suggest we are "halving" that circle, but note that if $x$ runs once around the great circle on $S^3$, it goes through pairs of antipodal points. After half a revolution on $S^3$, one reaches the antipodal point of the starting position. In $\mathbb{RP}^3$, that antipodal point is identified with the start. Thus **half** of the great circle on $S^3$ corresponds to a full loop in $\mathbb{RP}^3$. Either way, the topology is a circle.

**Corollary 2.1 (All Lines Loop in $\mathbb{RP}^3$).** Every "straight line" path in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ returns to its starting point. In other words, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has a _cyclic_ structure: it is impossible to escape to infinity along a straight line; the notion of "infinity" is integrated into the space as a point one reaches and passes through to come back home.

_Proof (Informal):_ Given any two distinct points $A, B \in \mathbb{RP}^3$, there is a unique projective line $\ell$ through them (projective geometry is _flat_ in this sense, just like Euclidean: two points determine a unique line). By the proposition, that line is a circle. If one starts at $A$ and moves toward $B$ along the line, continuing past $B$ in the same direction, eventually one circumnavigates the entire projective line and arrives back at $A$ from the opposite direction. There is no ``infinite'' endpoint where the journey stops; instead, _infinity is effectively a point on the line_ (albeit not part of the original Euclidean line, it's the added ideal point) that connects the two directions. This argument works for any line and any direction along it, so all straight-line trajectories in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ are closed loops.

**Remark:** The fact that lines in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ are closed distinguishes projective space from ordinary Euclidean space. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, a straight line is isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}$ (it extends infinitely in both directions). In $\mathbb{RP}^3$, by contrast, a line has the topology of $\mathbb{R}$ plus a point at infinity identified in a circular fashion, yielding $S^1$. This implies $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a _finite universe_. If we were to measure distances (say by pulling back the sphere's metric), any finite line segment could potentially be extended only up to some finite length before "wrap-around" occurs. Projectively, we usually don't talk about distances, but topologically, we know no line escapes to infinity. This is one reason $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is called **projectively closed**: all lines are _complete_ (closed) in the space ([Why is one infinity enough? : r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/c575bl/why_is_one_infinity_enough/#:~:text=you%20can%20diverge%20to%20infinity%2C,with%20antipodal%20boundary%20points%20identified)).

**Analogy (Traveling in a Closed Universe):** Imagine living in a 3D world where if you travel straight long enough, you eventually end up where you started. This scenario is analogous to life on a cylindrical planet or in a video game with a wrap-around world, but in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ the wrap-around is more extreme: **every direction** loops back on itself. For example, if you launch a rocket straight up into the sky in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, it won't drift off to infinity; instead, after a while it will appear from below, heading downward (the same trajectory from the opposite direction). This is similar to circumnavigating a globe: going far east brings you back from the west. In $\mathbb{RP}^3$, _all_ directions behave this way because the "points at infinity" in each direction have been glued together into the fabric of space. In fact, positive and negative directions along the same line become indistinguishable in projective space ([Why is one infinity enough? : r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/c575bl/why_is_one_infinity_enough/#:~:text=you%20can%20diverge%20to%20infinity%2C,with%20antipodal%20boundary%20points%20identified)). While this is hard to visualize in our usual three dimensions, the mathematical consequence is clear: straight lines are circles. This could be considered a 3D analog of the idea that in the projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, every straight line is a loop (which is true, though $\mathbb{RP}^2$ is harder to visualize since it can't be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ without self-intersection). The "closed universe" model of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has even been discussed in cosmology as a possible shape of space: it is finite yet has no edge where one could fall off.

## Generalized Cross-Ratios in $\mathbb{RP}^3$

Projective geometry is characterized by invariants under projective transformations. In one dimension (the projective line $\mathbb{RP}^1$), the fundamental invariant is the **cross-ratio** of four collinear points. Recall that given four distinct points $A, B, C, D$ on a line, their cross-ratio is defined as: (A,B;C,D)=AC/BCAD/BD=(AC⋅BD)(BC⋅AD),(A,B;C,D) = \frac{AC/BC}{AD/BD} = \frac{(AC \cdot BD)}{(BC \cdot AD)}, interpreting distances as signed ratios (or, in coordinate form, if $A,B,C,D$ have coordinates $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ on an affine line, then $(A,B;C,D) = \frac{(x_3 - x_1)(x_4 - x_2)}{(x_3 - x_2)(x_4 - x_1)}$) ([Cross-ratio - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio#:~:text=If%20%5BImage%206%3A%20,is%20given%20by)) ([Cross-ratio - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio#:~:text=%5BImage%209%3A%20%7B%5Cdisplaystyle%20%28x_%7B1%7D%2Cx_%7B2%7D%3Bx_%7B3%7D%2Cx_%7B4%7D%29%3D%7B%5Cfrac%20%7Bx_%7B3%7D,x_%7B1)). A crucial property is that this cross-ratio remains **invariant under any projective transformation** of the line ([Cross-ratio - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-ratio#:~:text=match%20at%20L550%20The%20cross,M%C3%B6bius%20transformation%20has%20the%20form)). In fact, the cross-ratio is the unique fundamental invariant of four points on $\mathbb{RP}^1$: any projective map (Möbius transformation) that sends one 4-tuple of points to another must preserve their cross-ratio.

In higher dimensions, the notion of cross-ratio can be generalized, although it becomes more complex. Instead of four collinear points, one typically needs a larger configuration of points (or other objects like planes or lines) to get a meaningful invariant, since projective transformations in higher dimension have more degrees of freedom. In $\mathbb{RP}^2$ (the plane), one example of a projective invariant is the cross-ratio of _five_ points in general position (no three collinear), often interpreted via the intersection of lines or use of conics ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=of%20the%20non,There%20are%20three%20fundamen%02tal)). In $\mathbb{RP}^3$ (space), it turns out that a minimal configuration to yield a scalar invariant is _six points_ in general position (no four coplanar, for instance). One can define **volume cross-ratios** involving six points, which generalize the cross-ratio concept to three dimensions ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=ratio%20of%20the%20volumes%20of,ratios%20are%20not)). These involve ratios of volumes of certain tetrahedra determined by the points.

Before defining the volume cross-ratio, let's introduce a convenient notation: given four points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4$ in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, we denote by $V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)$ the (signed) volume of the tetrahedron formed by any lifts of these points to homogeneous coordinates in $\mathbb{R}^4$. More concretely, if $\mathbf{p}_i$ is a representative 4-coordinate vector for $P_i$ (choosing an arbitrary scale for each, since homogeneous coordinates are determined up to scale), then V(P1,P2,P3,P4)=det⁡[p1,p2,p3,p4],V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4) = \det[\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2,\mathbf{p}_3,\mathbf{p}_4], the determinant of the $4\times 4$ matrix with columns $\mathbf{p}_1, \dots, \mathbf{p}_4$. This determinant is only defined up to an overall scalar factor depending on the choice of homogeneous representatives; however, any ratio of such determinants _is_ well-defined in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ because the scaling ambiguities cancel out. Geometrically, $|V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)|$ is proportional to the Euclidean volume of the tetrahedron (if we pick normalized representatives), and the sign of $V(\cdot)$ can be fixed by an orientation convention.

**Definition (Volume Cross-Ratio in $\mathbb{RP}^3$).** Given six points $P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5, P_6$ in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ (assumed to be in general position so that all the relevant determinants below are nonzero), we define a **volume cross-ratio** as follows:

CR(P1,P6;P2,P3,P4,P5)  =   V(P1,P2,P3,P4)  ⋅  V(P2,P3,P5,P6)  V(P1,P2,P4,P5)  ⋅  V(P3,P4,P5,P6)  .CR(P_1, P_6; P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5) \;=\; \frac{\,V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)\;\cdot\;V(P_2,P_3,P_5,P_6)\,}{\,V(P_1,P_2,P_4,P_5)\;\cdot\;V(P_3,P_4,P_5,P_6)\,}\,.

In words, we take the ratio of volumes of two tetrahedra, $P_1P_2P_3P_4$ and $P_2P_3P_5P_6$, and divide it by the ratio of volumes of two other tetrahedra, $P_1P_2P_4P_5$ and $P_3P_4P_5P_6$. This particular combination is chosen so that all $\mathbf{p}_i$ appear, and such that the expression is symmetric in a way that will make it invariant under projectivities. (There are actually several distinct cross-ratio invariants one can define with six points; for example, one could cyclically permute the roles of the points. In fact, it is known that there are three independent fundamental cross-ratio invariants in 3D ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=F%20%28n%29%20%28z%29%20%3D%20,z3%3B%20z2%2C%20z4%2C%20z5%2C%20z6)) ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=and%20CR,is%20the)), but for brevity we focus on one form.)

**Theorem 3 (Invariance of Volume Cross-Ratio).** The volume cross-ratio $CR(P_1, P_6; P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5)$ defined above is an invariant of the point configuration under projective transformations of $\mathbb{RP}^3$. That is, if $f: \mathbb{RP}^3 \to \mathbb{RP}^3$ is any projective transformation and we set $Q_i = f(P_i)$ for $i=1,\dots,6$, then CR(Q1,Q6;Q2,Q3,Q4,Q5)=CR(P1,P6;P2,P3,P4,P5).CR(Q_1, Q_6; Q_2, Q_3, Q_4, Q_5) = CR(P_1, P_6; P_2, P_3, P_4, P_5).

**Proof:** Any projective transformation of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is induced by an invertible $4\times 4$ linear transformation on the homogeneous coordinates. Let $f$ be represented (in homogeneous coordinates) by a matrix $M$ (with $\det M \neq 0$). This means that if $\mathbf{p}$ is a coordinate column-vector for a point $P$, then a coordinate for $Q=f(P)$ can be chosen as $\mathbf{q} = M,\mathbf{p}$ (again up to scaling). Now consider the volumes in the cross-ratio definition. We have, for example:

V(Q1,Q2,Q3,Q4)  =  det⁡[q1,q2,q3,q4]  =  det⁡[M p1,  M p2,  M p3,  M p4] .V(Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, Q_4) \;=\; \det[\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, \mathbf{q}_3, \mathbf{q}_4] \;=\; \det[M\,\mathbf{p}_1,\; M\,\mathbf{p}_2,\; M\,\mathbf{p}_3,\; M\,\mathbf{p}_4]\,.

Since $M$ is a linear operator, this equals

det⁡(M)  det⁡[p1,p2,p3,p4]  =  det⁡(M)  V(P1,P2,P3,P4) .\det(M) \;\det[\mathbf{p}_1,\mathbf{p}_2,\mathbf{p}_3,\mathbf{p}_4] \;=\; \det(M)\;V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4)\,.

In other words, each 4-point volume $V(\cdot)$ scales by the constant factor $\det(M)$ under the transformation $f$. Therefore, if we look at the value of the cross-ratio after transformation, we get: \begin{align*} CR(Q_1,Q_6;Q_2,Q_3,Q_4,Q_5) &= \frac{,V(Q_1,Q_2,Q_3,Q_4);\cdot;V(Q_2,Q_3,Q_5,Q_6),}{,V(Q_1,Q_2,Q_4,Q_5);\cdot;V(Q_3,Q_4,Q_5,Q_6),} \ &= \frac{,\det(M)V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4);\cdot;\det(M)V(P_2,P_3,P_5,P_6),}{,\det(M)V(P_1,P_2,P_4,P_5);\cdot;\det(M)V(P_3,P_4,P_5,P_6),} \ &= \frac{\det(M)^2}{\det(M)^2} ;\cdot; \frac{V(P_1,P_2,P_3,P_4),V(P_2,P_3,P_5,P_6)}{V(P_1,P_2,P_4,P_5),V(P_3,P_4,P_5,P_6)} \ &= CR(P_1,P_6;P_2,P_3,P_4,P_5),. \end{align*} Thus the value is unchanged. Geometrically, this invariance reflects the fact that the cross-ratio is built from _ratios of ratios_ of volumes, arranged so that the projective distortion factors cancel out ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=ratio%20of%20the%20volumes%20of,ratios%20are%20not)).

To appreciate why this combination corresponds to a projective invariant, it helps to see it as an analogue of the 1D cross-ratio. In one dimension, the cross-ratio $\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_4-x_2)}{(x_3-x_2)(x_4-x_1)}$ remains fixed because any linear-fractional transformation induces the same multiplicative factor on each difference, which cancels out in the ratio-of-ratios. In 3D, an arbitrary projective map can distort volumes of tetrahedra by some factor, but by taking a cleverly chosen ratio of four such volumes, we arrange that the distortion factor appears equally in numerator and denominator, as seen above. Our $CR(P_1,P_6;P_2,P_3,P_4,P_5)$ was chosen symmetrically (two tetrahedra sharing a face in the numerator, and two sharing a different face in the denominator) to ensure cancellation of the determinant factor of $M$. This is essentially the reason _why_ such a cross-ratio is invariant ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=ratio%20of%20the%20volumes%20of,ratios%20are%20not)).

**Remark:** The volume cross-ratio is one example of a joint invariant of six points in space. There are other forms—indeed, by permuting points, one can obtain two other independent invariants from six points ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=F%20%28n%29%20%28z%29%20%3D%20,z3%3B%20z2%2C%20z4%2C%20z5%2C%20z6)) ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=and%20CR,is%20the)). For instance, another cross-ratio could be CR′(P1,P3;P2,P4,P5,P6)=V(P1,P2,P4,P5) V(P3,P4,P5,P6)V(P1,P2,P4,P6) V(P3,P4,P5,P2)CR'(P_1,P_3; P_2,P_4,P_5,P_6) = \frac{V(P_1,P_2,P_4,P_5)\,V(P_3,P_4,P_5,P_6)}{V(P_1,P_2,P_4,P_6)\,V(P_3,P_4,P_5,P_2)} (which is essentially a relabeling of vertices in the definition). All such invariants are projectively invariant combinations of 4-point volume determinants. In classical projective geometry, these invariants allow one to distinguish configurations up to projectivity. For example, if two sextuples of points in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ have the same set of cross-ratio values (for the fundamental invariants), there is a projective transformation mapping one configuration to the other ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=The%20probabilistic%20analysis%20of%20random,more%20details%20the%20reader%20is)).

**Analogy (Cross-Ratios in Real Life):** In the one-dimensional case, cross-ratio has a clear real-world interpretation: if you look at four collinear points (say four landmarks along a straight road) from different perspectives (different viewpoints), the cross-ratio of their apparent positions is the same. This fact is exploited in computer vision and photography: the cross-ratio is an _affine-invariant_ and indeed _projective-invariant_ quantity used in camera calibration, since no matter the perspective distortion, the cross-ratio remains constant ([Projective Geometry/Classic/Projective Transformations - Wikibooks, open books for an open world](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Projective_Geometry/Classic/Projective_Transformations#:~:text=is%20the%20composition%20of%20a,1)). In three dimensions, it's harder to find an everyday example of the volume cross-ratio invariant, because it involves six points in general position. However, one could imagine using it in 3D reconstruction: if you have four reference points defining a base tetrahedron and two other points, the ratio defined above could, in theory, be used to verify if two setups of these six points are related by a projective transformation (like one being a photograph or 3D projection of the other). The _conceptual_ analogy is that just as the cross-ratio in 1D is the unique number preserved by all perspective changes of a collinear quadruple, the volume cross-ratio in 3D is a number preserved by all perspective changes (projectivities) of a sextuple of points in space ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=ratio%20of%20the%20volumes%20of,ratios%20are%20not)). While it’s challenging to directly visualize the volume cross-ratio, it serves as a mathematical reminder that projective geometry in higher dimensions, though more complex, still has algebraic invariants that play a role similar to the cross-ratio on a line.

## Projective Transformations and Incidence in $\mathbb{RP}^3$

A **projective transformation** (also called a _projectivity_ or _collineation_) of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is a bijective map $T: \mathbb{RP}^3 \to \mathbb{RP}^3$ that sends lines to lines (equivalently, it preserves the incidence structure of points lying on lines). Algebraically, every projective transformation in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ can be represented (in homogeneous coordinates) by an invertible $4\times4$ matrix, **unique up to scale**. In other words, $\text{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$, the projective general linear group on 4 coordinates, acts transitively on $\mathbb{RP}^3$ and gives all the projective automorphisms of the space. If we work in a specific affine patch (choosing a "finite" part of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ as $\mathbb{R}^3$), then projective transformations are generated by ordinary affine transformations plus transformations that send points to infinity and vice versa (e.g. a perspective projection). They are the most general transformations that map lines to lines (they may send circles or other curves to conics, etc., but incidence of straight lines and planes is preserved).

**Theorem 4 (Incidence Preservation by Projectivities).** Projective transformations in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ preserve all incidence relations. In particular:

- $T$ sends points to points, lines to lines, and planes to planes.
- If a point $P$ lies on a line $\ell$ (incidence), then $T(P)$ lies on the line $T(\ell)$. Similarly, if a line $L$ lies in a plane $\Pi$, then $T(L)$ lies in plane $T(\Pi)$.
- Consequently, any basic projective invariant such as collinearity, coplanarity, or cross-ratios (of collinear or coplanar configurations in appropriate sense) is preserved ([Projective Geometry/Classic/Projective Transformations - Wikibooks, open books for an open world](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Projective_Geometry/Classic/Projective_Transformations#:~:text=is%20the%20composition%20of%20a,1)).

_Sketch of Proof:_ In homogeneous coordinates, $T$ is given by a nonsingular linear map $x \mapsto Mx$. The condition for a point $[x]$ to lie on a line given by two points $[p], [q]$ is that $x, p, q$ are linearly dependent in $\mathbb{R}^4$ (their homogeneous coordinates satisfy a linear relation). If $x = \alpha p + \beta q$ for some scalars in the original configuration, then after applying $M$, we have $Mx = \alpha (Mp) + \beta (Mq)$. This shows $T([x])$ lies on the line through $T([p])$ and $T([q])$. Similar reasoning with three points and a plane (or using duality with planes represented dually) shows planes go to planes. Thus incidence is preserved. More conceptually, a projective transformation can be thought of as a composition of perspective projections (as from one plane to another) ([Projective Geometry/Classic/Projective Transformations - Wikibooks, open books for an open world](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Projective_Geometry/Classic/Projective_Transformations#:~:text=is%20the%20composition%20of%20a,1)), where it's geometrically evident that straight lines map to straight lines and incidence is not broken. We omit full details for brevity, but this is a standard result in projective geometry: _collinearity implies collinearity under projectivities_ ([Projective Geometry/Classic/Projective Transformations - Wikibooks, open books for an open world](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Projective_Geometry/Classic/Projective_Transformations#:~:text=is%20the%20composition%20of%20a,1)).

One important aspect of projective transformations is how they handle **points at infinity**. In an affine model of $\mathbb{RP}^3$, one identifies $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a subset of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ (by $ (x,y,z) \mapsto [x:y:z:1]$ in homogeneous coordinates). The complement of this affine patch in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is the set of points with homogeneous coordinate $[x:y:z:0]$, which constitutes the "plane at infinity" $\Pi_\infty \cong \mathbb{RP}^2$. This plane at infinity contains all the directions of lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Now, a projective transformation will, in general, **mix finite points and points at infinity**. It might send some finite point to an infinite point or vice versa. For instance, a perspective projection from one viewpoint might send a point on the horizon (infinite) to a nearby point (finite) in the image. However, because $\mathbb{RP}^3$ treats points at infinity on equal footing as finite points, the transformation is perfectly well-defined everywhere on the space.

**Proposition 5 (Identification of Infinity Yields Closed Loops).** In $\mathbb{RP}^3$, the identification of "points at infinity" (the entire ideal plane $\Pi_\infty$) into the space ensures that every line is closed as proved earlier. More specifically, what Euclidean geometry views as two "parallel" directions along the same line become a single cycle in projective space. The two opposite directions of any given line meet at a single point on $\Pi_\infty$, and this point is identified with both directions, thus completing the line as a loop ([Why is one infinity enough? : r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/c575bl/why_is_one_infinity_enough/#:~:text=Adding%20a%20circle%20at%20infinity,with%20antipodal%20boundary%20points%20identified)). Projective transformations reinforce this structure by freely moving the line or its intersection with $\Pi_\infty$ around, but never breaking the loop.

**Proof:** This is actually a rephrasing of earlier results in the language of the "plane at infinity." Consider any line $\ell$ in $\mathbb{RP}^3$. If we take an affine chart where $\Pi_\infty$ is treated as the horizon, $\ell$ will either be entirely within $\Pi_\infty$ (in which case it's a line at infinity — a special case that can be handled separately), or it will intersect $\Pi_\infty$ in one point (the "point at infinity" corresponding to the direction of that line in the affine sense). In Euclidean $\mathbb{R}^3$, a line extends to infinity in two opposite directions; in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, those two directions correspond to approaching the single point $\ell \cap \Pi_\infty$ from opposite sides. But since $\Pi_\infty$ is part of the space, that point is not an exit but rather a genuine point on the line. If one continues past that point (conceptually), one is now coming back along the same line but from the other direction in the affine chart. This shows that topologically, $\ell$ is a circle (homeomorphic to $S^1$). Projective transformations, which may carry $\ell$ to some other line or even send its infinite point to a finite location, preserve this closed-loop property because they do not fundamentally alter the topology — they just rearrange which point is "at infinity." For example, a projective transformation can take a line that was originally seen as infinite in one direction and make it a finite segment in another view, but then something else becomes the "new infinity." In all cases, the line still has a single intersection with the (transformed) plane at infinity, maintaining one loop rather than breaking into an open interval.

Stated differently, in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ there is **no special distinction between a point at infinity and an ordinary point** — any point can be considered as an "infinite" point after a suitable projective transformation. This homogeneity of points implies that the space has no boundary or limit points that are fundamentally unreachable; you can always reach what looked like infinity by some finite move after changing perspective. Thus all lines close on themselves.

To make this concrete, consider two parallel lines in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In Euclidean geometry, they never meet. In projective space, however, they intersect at a point on $\Pi_\infty$ (specifically, the point representing their common direction). A projective transformation can bring that ideal intersection point to a finite location, making the lines visibly intersect. This demonstrates the principle that **points at infinity are just like other points** in the eyes of projective geometry. By identifying all those "ends" of lines at infinity into actual points, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ ensures every pair of coplanar lines intersects (either in the affine part or at infinity) and every line is a closed curve.

**Real-World Analogy (Perspective and Vanishing Points):** The role of projective transformations in handling points at infinity can be illustrated by photography or perspective drawing. Imagine standing on a long straight road: the two edges of the road appear to converge at a vanishing point on the horizon (that point is essentially a point at infinity for the pair of parallel lines). In the real world, that "point" is not actually reachable — it's an illusion of perspective. But in the projective world, we consider that vanishing point as an actual point on the projective plane at infinity. Now, if you were to tilt your camera downwards (a projective transformation on the image plane), the vanishing point that was at the center of your horizon might move up and eventually out of your field of view, which is analogous to sending it to infinity in the new view; conversely, tilting in the other direction might bring an "infinite" point from outside into view. This is exactly what projective transformations do: they shuffle the line between finite and infinite. What remains invariant is the **incidence structure**: those road edges still intersect at some point in the projective sense, whether you see it in frame or not. In $\mathbb{RP}^3$, we don't need a separate concept for "parallel" — parallel lines _do intersect_, just not in the finite part of the space. The result is a cleaner, closed geometry. The **closed-loop structure** of lines can be likened to driving on a circular track: if you go straight long enough, you'll loop around. Projective identification of all directions makes space akin to a globe where heading straight north eventually brings you back from the south. The difference is, in $\mathbb{RP}^3$, _every_ direction has this behavior because the "north pole" and "south pole" of infinity are identified ([Why is one infinity enough? : r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/c575bl/why_is_one_infinity_enough/#:~:text=you%20can%20diverge%20to%20infinity%2C,with%20antipodal%20boundary%20points%20identified)) (there is essentially only one "pole" per direction pair).

Finally, it's worth noting that $\mathbb{RP}^3$ has deeper connections in mathematics and physics. For instance, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is isomorphic (as a smooth manifold) to the group of rotations in 3D, $SO(3)$ ([[PDF] The Quaternions and the Spaces S3, SU(2), SO(3), and RP](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis5150/gma-v2-chap9.pdf#:~:text=,This)). Under this isomorphism, the closed loops in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ correspond to how a $360^\circ$ rotation brings a physical object (like a molecule) back to its starting orientation (up to a subtle double-cover issue where a $360^\circ$ rotation in $SO(3)$ isn't the identity on the object, but a $720^\circ$ is — reflecting $\mathbb{RP}^3$ being $S^3$ with antipodal points identified). Thus, understanding $\mathbb{RP}^3$'s topology and projective geometry not only gives insight into pure mathematics but also into practical phenomena like orientation of bodies in space, computer vision (camera projective transformations), and even potential models of our universe's shape.

## Conclusion

We have undertaken a thorough exploration of real projective 3-space $\mathbb{RP}^3$, focusing on its topological closure properties and the geometric implications of projective identification. Starting from the construction of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ as $S^3$ with antipodal points identified, we proved that it is a compact 3-manifold with no boundary, essentially a "finite but edgeless" space ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=a%20%E2%81%A0%5BImage%2010%3A%20,n%2B1)). We saw that as a consequence, every line in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ is topologically a circle ([Real projective space - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=,Image%2025)), reinforcing the idea that one can never escape to infinity; instead, what appears as "infinity" in Euclidean terms is folded back into the space. This led us to discuss generalized cross-ratios in three dimensions, where we defined volume-based invariants for sextuples of points and verified their invariance under projective transformations ([](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Publications_files/Arora.DVSN.Chap.pdf#:~:text=ratio%20of%20the%20volumes%20of,ratios%20are%20not)). These invariants extend the classical cross-ratio from 1D and are key to understanding projective geometry in higher dimensions (with applications in areas like 3D reconstruction and recognition). Finally, we examined how projective transformations govern $\mathbb{RP}^3$, preserving incidence and effectively handling points at infinity by treating them like ordinary points ([Projective Geometry/Classic/Projective Transformations - Wikibooks, open books for an open world](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Projective_Geometry/Classic/Projective_Transformations#:~:text=is%20the%20composition%20of%20a,1)). We showed that identifying points at infinity into the fabric of the space yields a consistent closed-loop structure where lines meet themselves and parallel lines intersect at ideal points ([Why is one infinity enough? : r/math](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/c575bl/why_is_one_infinity_enough/#:~:text=Adding%20a%20circle%20at%20infinity,with%20antipodal%20boundary%20points%20identified)). Real-world analogies, such as wrap-around universes and perspective images, helped illustrate these abstract concepts in an intuitive manner.

In summary, $\mathbb{RP}^3$ emerges as a beautifully self-contained geometric universe. Its properties exemplify the elegance of projective geometry: **closure, symmetry, and invariance**. No point is special (not even "infinity"), no direction escapes, and certain cross-dimensional measurements remain ever fixed. This study, while rooted in pure mathematics, resonates with practical insight — from understanding the mathematics of camera optics to contemplating the global shape of space. We have maintained mathematical rigor in definitions, theorems, and proofs, aiming to satisfy experts, but we have also provided a layer of intuition to make the results accessible to any mathematically inclined reader. The topological and projective properties of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ underscore why projective spaces are central objects in geometry and topology, inviting further exploration into their algebraic structures, combinatorial properties (as in incidence geometry), and potential physical interpretations.
