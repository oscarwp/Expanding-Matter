Critical Note:
N=90 is the Neutron
N=89 is the Proton

Quarks are still n=29.  Up is oriented like most of the universe. Down is literally upside down--less stable because it will want to flip to orient with the rest of the universe.

When the quarks helix up one up gets a five ball ring as the start and then wraps with the middle one when the down one helixes and wraps going the other way until we get a configuration of 87 balls tightening as they compress under the force of their own magnetism two aditional magnetic balls are created from the compressing plenum in the structure.  It is stable in this state as as a proton at 89.  When it has balls on it's polls then it compresses further (mass decreases density increases) and a final 90th ball forms within the structure fully locked and magnetically satisfied.  

A scaled up version of individual balls of which is is composed.  I have the size difference some--oh shit... I need to get that in the papers.  Going to try to update this today.

The Proton is NOT n=90.  The Proton is n=89.  It has a charge and therefor is slightly magnetically frustrated.

This flips it with the Neutron.  The meaningful difference is that the Neutron has it's magnetic poles locked to another baryon.  If it's a configuration of 3 it would be like this:  P - N - P <-- a single three ball row of magnetic balls.  The Neutron is experiencing more magnetic constraint because it is surrounded by the other magnetic balls.  Those external balls to not have sometihing at both of their polls.  Therefor these balls exhibit charge when we inspect the structure.  One on one side would exhibit a positive or north and the other would be negative or south.
