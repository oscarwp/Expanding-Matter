## Real Projective 3-Space as the Topology of Physical Space

### Abstract

We prove that physical space has the topology of Real Projective 3-Space (RP³). The proof proceeds from four fundamental observations about spatial incidence relations: that two points determine a unique line, three non-collinear points determine a unique plane, two planes meet in a line, and there exist four points in general position. The Veblen-Young theorem establishes that any space satisfying these relations is isomorphic to projective n-space over a division ring. Combined with the three-dimensionality of physical space, this classification uniquely determines the topology as RP³. This multiply-connected topology is compact, locally Euclidean, and globally non-orientable.

### 1. Introduction

We prove that physical space has the topology of Real Projective 3-Space (RP³). The proof proceeds from four fundamental observations about spatial incidence relations. The Veblen-Young theorem provides a complete classification of all spaces satisfying these relations. Combined with the three-dimensionality of physical space, this classification yields RP³ as the unique solution.

### 2. The Observational Foundation

Physical space exhibits the following observable structural properties:

**Axiom 1:** Any two distinct points determine a unique line.

**Axiom 2:** Any three non-collinear points determine a unique plane.

**Axiom 3:** Any two distinct planes meet in a line.

**Axiom 4:** There exist four points, no three collinear and no four coplanar.

These axioms describe the incidence structure of physical space. They are not theoretical postulates but empirical observations about how spatial relationships function.

### 3. The Classification Theorem

**Theorem (Veblen-Young):** Any incidence structure satisfying Axioms 1-4 with dimension greater than or equal to three is isomorphic to projective n-space over some division ring K, denoted P^n(K).

This theorem provides the complete mathematical classification of spaces satisfying the observational axioms.

### 4. The Topological Proof

**Theorem:** The universe has the topology of Real Projective 3-Space (RP³).

**Proof:**

Physical space satisfies Axioms 1-4 as established through observation. By the Veblen-Young theorem, physical space is isomorphic to P^n(K) for some division ring K and dimension n.

The projective space P^n(K) has real dimension equal to n·d, where d represents the dimension of K as a real vector space.

Physical space is three-dimensional, therefore n·d = 3.

The only solution with n ≥ 3 (required by the Veblen-Young theorem) is n = 3 and d = 1.

When d = 1, the division ring K is isomorphic to the real numbers R.

Therefore, physical space is P³(R), which is Real Projective 3-Space (RP³) by definition. ∎

### 5. Conclusion

We have proven that the universe possesses RP³ topology. This conclusion derives from observable facts about spatial incidence combined with the Veblen-Young classification theorem.

The universe is not open or closed. It's both.

The shape of the universe is projective.
