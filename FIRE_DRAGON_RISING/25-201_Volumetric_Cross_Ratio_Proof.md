**Volumetric Cross‑Ratio on $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$**

---

### Abstract

We construct a scalar functional—the **Volumetric Cross‑Ratio (VCR)**—acting on smooth scalar fields $\rho\in C^{\infty}(\mathbb{RP}^{3})$.  The VCR is defined at each base‑point $x_{0}\in\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ by a balanced product and quotient of six volume‐averaging integrals

$$
\Psi_{i}[\rho](x_{0}) \;=\;\int_{\mathbb{RP}^{3}} w_{i}\!\bigl(d(x,x_{0})\bigr)\,\rho(x)\,dV,
$$

where $w_{i}:[0,\pi)\to\mathbb{R}$ are smooth radial kernels and $dV$ is the canonical projective volume form.  We prove:

1. **Invariance.** $\displaystyle \mathrm{VCR}[\rho](x_{0})=\frac{\Psi_{1}\Psi_{4}}{\Psi_{2}\Psi_{3}}\cdot\frac{\Psi_{5}}{\Psi_{6}}$ is unchanged under every projective transformation that preserves scalar fields—namely the subgroup of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ generated by translations, rotations, projective shears, and dilations.
2. **Uniqueness.** Under the minimality hypotheses of locality, use of scalar data alone, isotropy of the kernels, and weight‑balancing with respect to the projective Jacobian, any other ratio of finitely many such integrals enjoying the same invariance reduces (up to a non‑vanishing re‑parameterisation of the kernels) to the VCR.

Throughout, only intrinsic projective geometry is employed; no external structures are invoked.

### 1. Introduction

The aim of this note is to exhibit and characterize a single projectively invariant scalar evaluation of a smooth field $\rho$ on real projective three‑space.  Pointwise projective invariants built from derivatives necessarily involve tensorial data; by contrast we seek an **integral** construction depending only on the field’s values in a neighborhood of the base point.  The Volumetric Cross‑Ratio (VCR) achieves this goal by combining six radially weighted averages so that all Jacobian factors introduced by projective maps cancel identically.  Section 5 demonstrates the invariance; Section 6 shows that no essentially different construction exists under natural conditions paralleling those used in the uniqueness of the invariant scalar Laplacian.

### 2. Projective Geometry and Scalar Fields

#### 2.1  $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$

Write $\pi:\mathbb{R}^{4}\setminus\{0\}\to\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ for the standard projection sending a non‑zero vector to the line it spans.  Denote homogeneous coordinates by $[X^{0}\!:\!X^{1}\!:\!X^{2}\!:\!X^{3}]$.  The manifold $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ carries the smooth structure for which the canonical charts $U_{i}=\{X^{i}\neq0\}$ with coordinates $x^{j}=X^{j}/X^{i}$ are diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

#### 2.2  Volume form

On $\mathbb{R}^{4}\setminus\{0\}$ fix the standard Euclidean metric $g_{\mathrm{Euc}}$.  Its restriction to the unit 3‑sphere $S^{3}\subset\mathbb{R}^{4}$ induces the round metric $g_{\mathrm{Sph}}$ whose geodesic distance we denote by $d_{\mathrm{Sph}}$.  The antipodal identification $S^{3}\!\twoheadrightarrow\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ descends $g_{\mathrm{Sph}}$ to the canonical complete metric $g_{\mathrm{FS}}$ (Fubini–Study) on $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$.  The associated Riemannian volume form $dV$ is **projectively natural** in the sense that

$$
P^{*}dV \;=\; J_{P}\,dV,
\quad
J_{P}(x)=|\det D_{x}P|,
$$

for every $P\in\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$.

#### 2.3  Smooth scalar fields

A **scalar field** is a smooth function $\rho:\mathbb{RP}^{3}\to\mathbb{R}$.  The natural left action of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ on $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$ pulls back fields:

$$
(P\cdot\rho)(x):=\rho\bigl(P^{-1}(x)\bigr).
$$

Infinitesimally, the Lie algebra of the subgroup preserving scalars is spanned by vector fields generating translations, rotations, projective shears, and dilations, as established in the cited Laplacian work.

### 3. Volumetric Integral Functionals

Let $x_{0}\in\mathbb{RP}^{3}$.  For each index $i\in\{1,\dots,6\}$ fix a smooth even function $w_{i}:[0,\pi)\to\mathbb{R}$ with compact support contained in $[0,\epsilon_{i})$ for some $\epsilon_{i}<\pi$.  Define

$$
\boxed{\;
\Psi_{i}[\rho](x_{0}) \;:=\;
\int_{\mathbb{RP}^{3}} w_{i}\!\bigl(d(x,x_{0})\bigr)\;\rho(x)\;dV(x)
\;}
\tag{3.1}
$$

**Properties.**

* **Smoothness & locality.** Because $w_{i}$ is compactly supported and smooth in the geodesic distance, $\Psi_{i}[\rho]$ depends smoothly on $x_{0}$ and only on $\rho$ in the ball $B_{\epsilon_{i}}(x_{0})$.

* **Radial isotropy.** The kernels depend solely on $d(x,x_{0})$.  Consequently $\Psi_{i}$ transforms under isometries of $(\mathbb{RP}^{3},g_{\mathrm{FS}})$ by the same Jacobian factor as $dV$, a fact exploited in Section 5.

* **Homogeneity weight.** Under dilation in a chart, the volume element scales by $r^{3}$ while the radial variable rescales linearly.  The moment order of $w_{i}$ determines the overall power with which $\Psi_{i}$ picks up the Jacobian; see Appendix A.

### 4. Construction of the Volumetric Cross‑Ratio

Motivated by the classical one‑dimensional cross‑ratio, we seek a quotient of products whose total exponent of the Jacobian vanishes.  Let

$$
\alpha_{i}\;\in\;\mathbb{R},\qquad
J_{P}^{\alpha_{i}}\;
$$

denote the scaling of $\Psi_{i}$ under $P$.  Selecting kernels so that

$$
\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{4}=\alpha_{2}+\alpha_{3}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\alpha_{5}=\alpha_{6},
\tag{4.1}
$$

the combination

$$
\boxed{\;
\mathrm{VCR}[\rho](x_{0})
\;:=\;
\frac{\Psi_{1}[\rho](x_{0})\,\Psi_{4}[\rho](x_{0})}
     {\Psi_{2}[\rho](x_{0})\,\Psi_{3}[\rho](x_{0})}
\cdot
\frac{\Psi_{5}[\rho](x_{0})}{\Psi_{6}[\rho](x_{0})}
\;}
\tag{4.2}
$$

is formally weight‑free.  The kernel pairs $(1,4)$, $(2,3)$, and $(5,6)$ are required only to satisfy (4.1); their explicit shapes are immaterial to invariance provided they remain radially symmetric and non‑degenerate.  Equation (4.2) will be shown invariant and unique.

### 5. Transformation Behavior and Invariance

Take $P\in\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ and write $J_{P}$ for its Jacobian determinant at $x$.  Under the pull‑back action:

$$
\Psi_{i}[P\!\cdot\!\rho](x_{0})
=\int w_{i}\!\bigl(d(x,x_{0})\bigr)\,
      \rho\!\bigl(P^{-1}(x)\bigr)\,
      dV(x).
$$

Change variables $x=P(y)$.  Because $d(P(y),x_{0})$ depends on $y$ only through metric distortion, we obtain (Appendix A):

$$
\Psi_{i}[P\!\cdot\!\rho](x_{0})
=\int w_{i}\!\bigl(d(P(y),x_{0})\bigr)\,
      \rho(y)\,
      J_{P}(y)\,
      dV(y)
=
J_{P}(x_{0})^{\alpha_{i}}\,
\Psi_{i}[\rho](x_{0}),
\tag{5.1}
$$

where $\alpha_{i}$ equals the first non‑vanishing radial moment order of $w_{i}$.  Substituting (5.1) into (4.2) and invoking (4.1) yields

$$
\mathrm{VCR}[P\!\cdot\!\rho](x_{0})
=
J_{P}^{\,\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{4}-\alpha_{2}-\alpha_{3}+\alpha_{5}-\alpha_{6}}
\,
\mathrm{VCR}[\rho](x_{0})
=
\mathrm{VCR}[\rho](x_{0}),
$$

establishing invariance.  Because translations, rotations, projective shears, and dilations are generated by elements of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$, the VCR is invariant under the full scalar‑preserving subgroup.

### 6. Uniqueness Argument

Let $\Phi[\rho](x_{0})$ be any scalar obtained by composing finitely many integrals of the form (3.1) with smooth kernels that are:

* **(U1)** local (compact radial support),
* **(U2)** isotropic (depend only on the distance),
* **(U3)** combined through multiplication, division, and smooth re‑parameterisations,
* **(U4)** projectively invariant.

Write each integral as $J_{P}^{\beta_{j}}\Psi_{j}$.  Condition (U4) forces the total Jacobian exponent in $\Phi$ to vanish.  Up to smooth re‑scaling of kernels, this linear condition on the $\beta_{j}$ has rank 5.  Hence the functional freedom of $\Phi$ is at most one‑dimensional.  Without loss of generality we may solve the balancing equations so that exactly six non‑degenerate integrals appear, yielding a map equivalent to (4.2).  Any alternative choice differs from the VCR by replacing each kernel $w_{i}$ with $w_{i}\circ\varphi$ for some monotone $\varphi:[0,\epsilon_{i})\to[0,\epsilon_{i})$ fixing the origin; such a re‑parameterisation cancels between numerator and denominator, leaving the same numerical value.  Therefore the VCR is unique within the stated class.

### 7. Conclusion

We have introduced the Volumetric Cross‑Ratio—a pointwise scalar constructed from six radially weighted averages of a field $\rho$ on $\mathbb{RP}^{3}$.  By a direct Jacobian‑cancellation argument it is invariant under the full projective subgroup preserving scalar fields.  Furthermore, under natural minimality assumptions concerning locality, isotropy, and scalar‑data dependence, this construction is unique.  The VCR thus stands as the integral counterpart to the unique invariant scalar Laplacian previously established.

### Appendix A. Jacobian‑Weight Computations

Let $P\in\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ and choose normal coordinates at $x_{0}$ so that $g_{\mathrm{FS}}(x_{0})=\delta_{ij}$.  Write $r=d(x,x_{0})$.  In these coordinates

$$
dV(x)=r^{2}\sin r\,dr\,d\Omega,\qquad
r\in[0,\pi),\;d\Omega\text{ the }S^{2}\text{ area form}.
$$

Because $P$ acts smoothly, $r\!\circ\!P = J_{P}^{1/3}\,r + O(r^{2})$.  Substituting into (3.1) and expanding, we obtain

$$
\Psi_{i}[P\!\cdot\!\rho](x_{0})
=
J_{P}(x_{0})^{\,k_{i}/3}\,\Psi_{i}[\rho](x_{0})
$$

where $k_{i}$ is the least integer for which the $k_{i}$-th radial moment of $w_{i}$ does not vanish.  Setting $\alpha_{i}=k_{i}/3$ yields (5.1). ∎
