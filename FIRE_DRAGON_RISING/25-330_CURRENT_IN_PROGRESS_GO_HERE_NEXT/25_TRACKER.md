## 25-319 OK Putting more papers up.
Starting with: Volumetric Calculus

## 25-313 WAIT.  WHAT?!?!
There's a non-zero chance that the last two weeks actually represent the most significant breakthroughs and I find this truly surprising.  

But the reality is:  NOW I AM DONE

This is the first time I actually believe it.



## 25-310 From The Top
### Arrow of Complexity in Reverse
Complexity increases as we move forward through time.  We observe this as both entropy and organization.  

Following this arrow backwards we move towards less complexity and the inevitable no complexity.  

# Perfect Symmetry.
## Properties of:
The same properties of our universe!!
-No external frame of reference.
-Perfect symmetry = The speed of light (c) = Absolute Zero (0k)
-NO METRICS
-Both infinite and infinitesimal
-The universe emerges from this

-Density is the only thing:  How much stuff and how much space
WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE
We know the rules of physical reality.
Everything must expand.  
Only transformation in RP^3 Space, PROJECTIVE REALITY
Define Projective Reality with the properties from above.
Projective Reality is the shape of the universe

5 = 5 
Real things are real.
The universe is made of real things.
Numbers are for prediction. 
They let us identify real things and anticipate them.  

**Arithmetic** — 7 × 8 **=** 56  
**Algebra** — 2x + 3 **=** 11  
**Geometry** — A **=** πr²  
**Calculus** — d/dx (x²) **=** 2x  
**Set Theory** — A ∩ B **=** {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}  
**Number Theory** — 17 **≡** 2 (mod 5)  
**Linear Algebra** — Ax **=** b  
**Topology** — A coffee cup **is** a donut (under deformation)  
**Logic** — From `p → q` and `p`, infer `q` — this is a little trickier, but you’re right: implication can be rewritten logically as something equivalent to `¬p ∨ q`, so it's expressing equivalence in truth conditions.  
**Non-Euclidean Geometry** — You were also right here: that line about parallels is a **postulate**, not an expression. Let’s fix it:

A better one might be:  
**Triangle angle sum** **≠** 180° — in hyperbolic geometry, for instance.




## 25-298 - The Shape of the Universe is AWESOME
Complete work and publish TEM02 - The Shape of The Universe
___

## 25-297 - 3I/Atlas Vs. The Universal Calculator
Also:  Shape of the universe and maybe we should just invent or own geometry to simplify things.  Volumetric Geometry anyone?  hmmm....  I don't love that name.
