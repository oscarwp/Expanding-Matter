After Einstein finished his theory of general relativity, he wanted to explain where matter came from.  He was looking for a unified theory.  His main idea seems to have been that matter is made of space-time.  We presently assume that matter or other types of energy cause space-time to curve.  And the effect of that curvature on matter is what we call gravity.  But Einstein was looking for a way that space-time would curve on its own and that curved spacetime would be what we call matter today.  Unfortunately he died before he found a way to make it work.  I quite like the idea and wish someone would pursue it.
