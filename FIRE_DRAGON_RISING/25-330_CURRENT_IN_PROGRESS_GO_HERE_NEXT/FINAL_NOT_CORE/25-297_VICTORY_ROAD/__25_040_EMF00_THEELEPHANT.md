# Expanding Matter Framework (EMF) in a Cyclical RP³ Universe

**Overview:** The Expanding Matter Framework (EMF) is a theoretical formulation grounded in the Expanding Matter Framework (EMF) that describes the universe purely in terms of **continuous expansion** within a _3-dimensional real projective space_ (RP³). In this picture, reality emerges from a single fundamental geometric operation – expansion – rather than from separate fundamental forces. Space is treated as a **closed, cyclical 3D projective geometry** (RP³ is a compact 3D manifold obtained by identifying antipodal points of a sphere​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=a%20%E2%81%A0%5BImage%2010%3A%20,n%2B1)

), meaning there is no boundary or edge to space, and directions “at infinity” loop back consistently. Within this RP³, **absolute size or distance has no invariant meaning** – only _projective ratios_ and geometric relations matter. This ensures _projective invariance_: physics should not depend on overall scale, only on relative configurations.

Under PEF, all physical interactions (gravity, electromagnetism, nuclear forces) are reinterpreted as manifestations of constraints on the universal expansion. Time itself is not a built-in dimension but arises as a measure of how this expansion progresses. The goal is to develop a rigorous mathematical structure where the **expansion of matter** is the single underlying process, and all known laws of physics emerge from the geometry of expansion. This framework prioritizes internal logical consistency and cognitive intuitiveness, aiming to serve as the “ultimate geometric language” of reality.

Below, we develop each key aspect of EMF in turn, formulating the fundamental expansion operator, expressing forces as expansion constraints, deriving time as a scaling parameter, constructing projectively invariant laws, optimizing the notation for human intuition, and finally assessing the completeness of RP³ as the language of the universe.

## 1. Projective Expansion as the Fundamental Operator

**Defining the Expansion Operator in RP³:** We posit that the _fundamental operator_ of the universe is the **Projective Expansion Operator** E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​, which encodes the uniform expansion of all matter and space within RP³. Mathematically, E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ can be defined as a generator of _dilations_ (scalings) in three-dimensional space. For example, in Cartesian coordinates x,y,zx,y,zx,y,z, one representation is:

E^proj=x ∂∂x+y ∂∂y+z ∂∂z .\hat{E}_{\text{proj}} = x\,\frac{\partial}{\partial x} + y\,\frac{\partial}{\partial y} + z\,\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\,. E^proj​=x∂x∂​+y∂y∂​+z∂z∂​.

This differential operator xi∂/∂xix_i \partial/\partial x_ixi​∂/∂xi​ (summing i=1i=1i=1 to 3) generates an infinitesimal expansion — it drives a flow that carries any point P(x,y,z)P(x,y,z)P(x,y,z) radially outward. Intuitively, applying E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ causes PPP to move directly away from the origin, increasing its distance while preserving the direction. Integrating this flow yields a one-parameter family of **projective transformations** E(τ)E(\tau)E(τ) corresponding to a scale-factor change. For instance, E(τ):(x,y,z)↦(eτx, eτy, eτz)E(\tau): (x,y,z) \mapsto (e^{\tau}x,\ e^{\tau}y,\ e^{\tau}z)E(τ):(x,y,z)↦(eτx, eτy, eτz), which in homogeneous coordinates [X:Y:Z:W][X:Y:Z:W][X:Y:Z:W] of RP³ corresponds to a change in the ratio of physical coordinates to the homogeneous scale coordinate WWW. Because points in RP³ are defined up to an overall scale, a **uniform scaling of all coordinates does not change a point’s identity** in projective space. Instead, E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ should be thought of as shifting the _representative_ of each projective point along the line through the origin — effectively moving the “gauge” of size. In a universe where **only relative scale matters**, E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ is the natural fundamental operator: it generates changes in the _projective scale_ of the system.

**Universal Expansion as Geometry:** With E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ defined, the _state of the universe_ at any moment can be described by the distribution of matter in RP³ (which gives the shape of spatial relations) along with a global projective scale parameter. The **dynamics of the universe reduce to how that scale parameter changes**, i.e. how the expansion unfolds over what we perceive as time. Crucially, in EMF there is no separate “spacetime” with a time dimension – instead, time will emerge from successive applications of E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​. The expansion operator acts across all of space simultaneously (reflecting the EMF postulate that all matter is expanding together). Thus, the **universe’s evolution is described by geometric transformations in RP³**: each “tick” of evolution uniformly rescales all lengths (while leaving direction ratios invariant). Because RP³ is a projective (angle- and ratio-preserving) space, such transformations can be viewed as _projective mappings_ that preserve straight lines and incidence relations, ensuring a coherent geometry at every stage.

**Forces as Constraints on Expansion:** If expansion is the only fundamental process, then what we call forces must emerge from deviations or constraints in this expansion. In the purest form, if nothing hindered expansion, every region of space would simply dilate equivalently under E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​. Forces enter the framework as **local or relational constraints on the universal expansion** – effectively, they represent places where expansion _differs from the ideal_. We do **not introduce separate force fields** on top of expansion; instead, each interaction is an emergent phenomenon indicating that the expansion operator’s action is _modified_ or _constrained_ by some condition (e.g. presence of mass or charge). Mathematically, this means physical laws will appear as conditions on E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​’s flow field. For example, gravity might be represented by a local divergence deficit of the expansion flow in the presence of mass (see §2), and electromagnetism by a geometrical phase condition on overlapping expansion flows (see §2). All such laws should be expressible as statements about the geometry of RP³ under expansion, rather than as fundamental fields living on space. This approach mirrors the spirit of gauge theories, where requiring symmetry invariances yields interaction fields; here, requiring **projective symmetry (scale invariance)** yields interactions as necessary corrections to uniform expansion.

By making E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ the centerpiece, we enforce a **projectively invariant description of physics**: no result can depend on an absolute length scale, only on shape and ratios. This aligns with the idea that one can formulate gravity in a _dimensionless_ way by trading the time dimension for scale invariance​

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6264#:~:text=quantum%20gravity,We%20show%20that%20in%20this)

. In fact, a similar concept appears in shape dynamics and Weyl’s geometry: eliminating absolute scale (making length units arbitrary at each point) can yield a richer symmetry that naturally introduces fields like electromagnetism​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=Weyl%20%20in%201918.,Weyl%27s%201929)

. EMF takes this principle to the extreme – **expansion (change of scale) is the single dynamical generator**, and all physics must be derived from it.

In summary, E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ is defined to encapsulate _universal expansion in RP³_. All structure in the universe – from planetary orbits to electromagnetic waves – will be described as either free expansion (when unconstrained) or deviations from free expansion due to mutual interactions. This sets the stage for reinterpreting forces in the next section.

## 2. Forces as Expansion Constraints

If expansion is the universal “default” behavior, then **forces arise when the expansion is locally altered or impeded**. We replace the concept of fundamental forces with that of **expansion constraints** – rules that dictate how the presence of matter-energy affects the expansion flow. We now formulate gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear interactions in these terms:

- **Gravity as an Expansion Deficit:** Gravity is reconceived as a _local deficit in the expected expansion_. A massive object “consumes” or slows the expansion in its vicinity, causing neighboring matter to expand less (or later in phase) than it would in free space. The result is that other objects appear to be pulled inward toward the mass – not because of a direct attraction, but because the space between them isn’t expanding as fast as elsewhere, effectively drawing them together. In PEF, one can define a scalar expansion field Θ(r)=∇⋅vexp(r) \Theta(\mathbf{r}) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{exp}}(\mathbf{r})Θ(r)=∇⋅vexp​(r) representing the local expansion rate (the divergence of the expansion velocity field). **Mass generates a negative perturbation** δΘ\delta \ThetaδΘ in this field. Mathematically, we might postulate an equation like ∇⋅vexp=H0−4πGρ(r) \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{exp}} = H_0 - 4\pi G \rho(\mathbf{r})∇⋅vexp​=H0​−4πGρ(r) (analogous to Gauss’s law), meaning the presence of mass density ρ\rhoρ reduces the local expansion rate below the cosmic rate H0H_0H0​. This “expansion deficit” leads to convergence of trajectories (what we interpret as gravitational attraction). In qualitative terms, a planet’s mass causes the space around it to expand more slowly; an object near the planet continues to expand elsewhere in its own frame, but the region between it and the planet does not expand as much, so they end up closer together over time. **Gravity is thus the manifestation of curved expansion flow**: matter curves the trajectories of expansion such that geodesics (straightest paths in projective space) converge. This idea is consistent with the view that gravity is not a pull but the result of spacetime (or here, expansion field) dynamics – “mass tells expansion how to proceed”. Indeed, an alternative theory has suggested that gravity can be seen as a _push_ due to cosmic expansion​

    [scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=123051#:~:text=expansion%20of%20space)
    
    : as massive bodies undergo accelerated _broadening_ (expansion), they push outward on space, and being immersed in this common expansion, masses push each other together. EMF provides a geometric basis for this: the “push” is simply the surrounding space continuing to expand while the space directly between masses lags (an **expansion gradient**). Objects then move toward the region of slower expansion (much as buoyant objects drift to where pressure is lower). In a formal projective sense, gravity corresponds to a condition on E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ such as E^proj}(gμν)=0\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}\}(g_{\mu\nu}) = 0E^proj​}(gμν​)=0 with gμνg_{\mu\nu}gμν​ a metric emergent from expansion – essentially Einstein’s equation could emerge from requiring the expansion flow to be divergence-free except where matter is present, producing curvature​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=possibility%20of%20invariance%2C%20when%20he,remained%20unnoticed%20until%20Weyl%27s%20work)
    
    . In sum, gravity is an _emergent curvature of the expansion geometry_ – a deficit angle or slower scaling rate around mass. This recasts Newton’s and Einstein’s gravity in terms of expansion: free expansion would fling galaxies apart, but mass creates _expansion wells_ that keep structures bound (no separate graviton field needed).
    
- **Electromagnetism as Phase Matching of Expansion Fields:** In PEF, electromagnetic phenomena arise from the requirement of _phase alignment in overlapping expansion influences_. We imagine that charged matter not only expands but does so in an **oscillatory or oriented manner**, introducing a phase factor to its expansion field. For instance, a positive charge might impart a certain oscillatory expansion pattern (or a divergence of expansion field lines outward), whereas a negative charge imparts an opposite phase (convergence of field lines inward). When two such expansion fields overlap, **their phases must synchronize for coherent expansion to continue** – this leads to either constructive or destructive interference in the expansion field, which corresponds to electromagnetic attraction or repulsion. In more concrete terms, **like charges** both produce expansion fields that are in the same phase (say, both push outward). When their fields overlap, they reinforce each other’s expansion in the space between them, creating a higher expansion pressure in that region that drives the charges apart (repulsion) to restore uniformity. **Opposite charges**, on the other hand, produce expansion fields 180° out of phase (one’s expansion is the other’s contraction); when overlapped, they partially cancel each other’s expansion in the intervening space, lowering the expansion pressure between them. The surrounding space, still expanding normally, then pushes the charges together – we observe this as electrostatic attraction. This description can be framed in terms of a **phase-matching condition**: the stability of the expansion field requires that around a bound system of charges, the net expansion field has consistent phase. If the phases differ, the system can reduce its free energy by adjusting positions until the fields align in a compatible way (minimal interference). Mathematically, we might represent the electromagnetic field as a _connection_ that ensures the expansion phase is single-valued around a loop. Indeed, this is reminiscent of gauge theory: requiring that a phase (gauge) be smoothly defined everywhere introduces a compensating field (the electromagnetic potential). Historically, **Weyl’s 1918 theory** attempted to unify gravity and electromagnetism by making scale (length) a local gauge, and found that a varying phase (scale factor) field could act like electromagnetism​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=Weyl%20%20in%201918.,Weyl%27s%201929)
    
    . In PEF, we echo this: electromagnetism emerges because the _local projective scale/phase_ must be adjusted when charges are present. The **Maxwell equations** would appear as conditions on the expansion field’s phase continuity – for example, Gauss’s law for electricity ∇⋅E=ρ\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho∇⋅E=ρ becomes a statement that a net divergence (expansion source) is present at a positive charge, and Faraday’s law ∇×E=−∂B/∂t\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\partial \mathbf{B}/\partial t∇×E=−∂B/∂t can be seen as ensuring no discontinuity in phase as expansion changes in time. The **force** between charges is then interpreted as the result of constructive vs. destructive interference of their expansion fields (analogous to wave interference where in-phase waves produce higher amplitude (repulsion) and out-of-phase waves cancel (attraction))​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#:~:text=The%20principle%20of%20superposition%20of,of%20destructive%20interference%2C%20the%20wave)
    
    ​

    . Notably, electromagnetic radiation (light) in this framework is a _propagating ripple in the expansion field_ – a region where expansion oscillates (phases inverting periodically) and this oscillation self-perpetuates through the projective space. Overall, electromagnetism in EMF is not a fundamental interaction transmitted by virtual photons, but rather a **geometric consequence** of how expansion fields from different sources superpose and seek equilibrium. Charge conservation would correspond to topological constraints (flux of expansion field lines is conserved in RP³), and the **bi-polar nature** of charges (positive/negative) reflects the bidirectional nature of expansion deviations (source vs. sink of expansion flow). This re-interpretation is different in language but reproduces Coulomb’s law and Maxwell’s equations in effect, as those equations ensure the proper matching of field “phases” and continuity.
    
- **Nuclear Forces as Multi-Body Expansion Constraints:** The strong and weak nuclear forces bind particles at subatomic scales, and in EMF these too are explained by expansion constraints, but of a higher order involving multiple bodies. In atomic nuclei, several protons and neutrons are packed extremely closely. Each of these particles is expanding, and their expansion fields overlap intensely. For the nucleus to remain stable, **the expansion of all constituent particles must be tightly coordinated** – any slight mismatch would be magnified at these densities, blowing the nucleus apart. Thus, the **strong nuclear force** can be seen as the _constraint that enforces collective expansion coherence among multiple particles_. When nucleons are at the right separation and configuration, their expansion fields lock together in a stable, minimal-energy configuration (like gears meshing). This produces a very strong binding, because any attempt to perturb one nucleon’s position or phase would greatly increase the expansion mismatch (resulting in a huge “restoring force”). We can liken this to a _multi-body resonance_ in the expansion field: a nucleus is stable when the geometric arrangement of nucleons allows their expansion waves to constructively interfere in a self-reinforcing loop. If they get too close, however, their expansion fields overlap too completely, causing a phase clash – this corresponds to the repulsive core of the nuclear force at very short ranges (nucleons resist being pushed into each other because their expansion patterns cannot both hold in the same space). If they get too far, the coordination breaks down and the nucleus falls apart. In RP³ terms, a **higher-order projective invariant** might govern nuclear binding. For example, three or more bodies could be required to satisfy a conserved projective volume or solid angle. One could imagine an invariant like the _projective volume_ (a triple product of position vectors) being extremized for a bound configuration. This is speculative, but hints that nuclear forces are tied to _collective geometric invariants_ that only manifest for multi-body systems. Interestingly, the Standard Model’s description of the strong force involves an SU(3) gauge symmetry acting on a color triplet of quarks​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=confusion%20in%20elementary%20particle%20physics,The%20Standard%20Model)
    
    – essentially a requirement that quarks come together in threes (or quark-antiquark pairs) to form color-neutral hadrons. This resonates with the EMF idea that **three-body constraints** are fundamental for the strong force. EMF would say: three quarks expanding in concert can form a stable projective configuration (a proton/neutron) because a certain projective phase invariant (analogous to “color” charge) is satisfied only when all three are present. Remove one, and the invariant (and hence the bound state) is lost. Likewise, the **weak nuclear force** can be interpreted as a consequence of expansion stability thresholds. The weak force governs particle decay and transmutation (e.g. a neutron decaying into a proton, electron, neutrino). In PEF, such a decay might occur when the expansion constraints for multi-body stability are no longer satisfied – for instance, if a lone neutron’s expansion field cannot remain coherent (since a neutron is essentially a proton+electron-like system bound by expansion temporarily), it “breaks apart” to re-establish expansion equilibrium, emitting particles (which carry away the expansion discrepancies). The mathematics of this would involve _projective consistency conditions_ failing beyond a certain configuration, analogous to how in standard theory a heavy nucleus will eventually decay if the binding can’t hold all components indefinitely. One could potentially derive selection rules for decays from projective geometry (e.g. certain configurations of expansion phase and invariants are forbidden, reflecting conservation laws like lepton and baryon number in another guise).
    

In summary, **all forces in EMF are unified as manifestations of one principle: uniform expansion striving to occur, and any deviation from it creating a feedback that we interpret as a force.** Gravity is a _global shape distortion_ of expansion caused by mass (a deficit causing convergence), electromagnetism is a _vectorial phase condition_ in expansion caused by charge (leading to alignment or anti-alignment of expansion flows), and nuclear forces are _higher-order coherence requirements_ in dense, multi-particle expansion systems. There are no separate force-carrying particles or fields at bedrock – those appear in emergent effective theories when one linearizes or quantizes the expansion constraints. Notably, this approach naturally encodes **conservation laws**: because forces are geometry constraints, things like energy or charge conservation correspond to topological invariants of the expansion field (e.g. Gauss’s law follows from the fact that expansion field lines in RP³ neither start nor end except on charges, etc.). This is analogous to how in gauge theory a symmetry leads to a conservation law; here the symmetry is projective (scale) invariance, and the “conserved charge” might be related to the Eulerian characteristics of the expansion flow.

By treating forces as expansion constraints, EMF aims to **explain why the known interactions have the particular form they do**. They are exactly those needed to _preserve a consistent expansion of the universe in the presence of structure_. The strength and range of forces correlate with how sensitive expansion is to perturbation at different scales: gravity is very weak and long-range because a small deficit in a vast cosmic expansion field accumulates effects over great distances; electromagnetism is stronger and medium-range because phase differences in local expansion fields cause immediate adjustments but can cancel out over distance (thanks to positive/negative charge polarity); the strong force is extremely strong but very short-range because multi-body expansion coherence is only relevant at tiny scales (once nucleons are a few diameters apart, their expansion fields no longer require coordination, hence no force). All of these qualitative behaviors align with observation, now with a unifying interpretation.

## 3. Emergent Time and Scaling Transformations

A cornerstone of EMF is that **time is not a fundamental dimension** of the universe but rather an emergent _parameter_ that tracks the progression of the universal expansion. In a sense, **time is the “clock of expansion”** – it is how we label the continuous projective transformations generated by E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​. This section reframes the concept of time and derives how time emerges from scaling in RP³, including the functional form of this relationship.

- **Time as a Scaling Parameter:** In the expanding-matter view, what we perceive as the passage of time is in fact the change in the scale of all matter. Imagine “freeze-framing” the universe at various stages of expansion – each frame is a snapshot in RP³ (where only the relative sizes matter). These frames can be ordered by a parameter τ\tauτ which increases as the scale increases. We identify this ordering parameter with **time**. Crucially, τ\tauτ does **not** appear as a coordinate in the fundamental geometry; it arises as a way to parametrize the continuous group of expansion transformations E(τ)E(\tau)E(τ). Unlike a traditional 4th dimension, τ\tauτ does not mix with spatial coordinates under projective transformations – it is an external label for the sequence of homogeneous dilations. This matches a relational view of time: time is the relation between successive states of the configuration of matter. As Julian Barbour and others have argued, if one formulates physics in a fully scale-invariant way, time can be viewed as a measure of change rather than a fundamental backdrop​
    
    [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6264#:~:text=quantum%20gravity,We%20show%20that%20in%20this)
    
    . EMF encapsulates this by saying **time = change of projective scale**.
    
- **Encoding Time in RP³ Transformations:** How can we mathematically express the passage of time as a transformation in RP³? Consider the homogeneous coordinates [X:Y:Z:W][X:Y:Z:W][X:Y:Z:W] for a point in RP³ (with two points identified if one is a scalar multiple of the other). We can interpret WWW as an _inverse scale_ coordinate (for example, in a given epoch we might normalize coordinates so that W=1W=1W=1 for all physical points). A **global expansion** by factor a>1a > 1a>1 can be represented projectively as: [X:Y:Z:W]↦[X:Y:Z:1aW][X:Y:Z:W] \mapsto [X:Y:Z:\frac{1}{a}W][X:Y:Z:W]↦[X:Y:Z:a1​W]. After rescaling, to return to the normal form where W=1W=1W=1, we would divide through by the new WWW, effectively making spatial coordinates X,Y,ZX,Y,ZX,Y,Z larger by aaa. In this way, one can think of 1/W1/W1/W as a global scale factor S(τ)S(\tau)S(τ). Time τ\tauτ enters as the parameter in S(τ)S(\tau)S(τ). For instance, we might set up a differential equation for the scale factor: dSdτ=f(S), \frac{dS}{d\tau} = f(S) ,dτdS​=f(S), with some function fff describing how fast scaling accelerates. If expansion is uniform in a logarithmic sense (constant fractional growth per unit τ\tauτ), we get S(τ)=eατS(\tau) = e^{\alpha \tau}S(τ)=eατ for some α\alphaα. In that case, τ=1αln⁡S\tau = \frac{1}{\alpha} \ln Sτ=α1​lnS. This would imply **time is proportional to the logarithm of the scale** – each additive tick of time multiplies the universe’s scale by a constant factor (this is analogous to how cosmic inflation or exponential expansion works). On the other hand, if expansion has a constant second-derivative (like constant acceleration of scale), one might get S(τ)∝τ2S(\tau) \propto \tau^2S(τ)∝τ2, meaning τ∝S\tau \propto \sqrt{S}τ∝S​. This would mean time grows like the square-root of the scale (or equivalently, scale grows quadratically with time). These are two plausible relationships the user has in mind: **logarithmic vs. quadratic time-scale dependence**. EMF does not presume one a priori; rather, it should be derivable from the dynamics of expansion constraints.
    
- **Logarithmic vs. Quadratic Time Dependence:** We investigate the nature of time’s dependence on the projective scale coordinate by considering physical scenarios. If the universe’s expansion rate is proportional to its current size (a self-similar expansion), we have S˙/S=const\dot{S}/S = \text{const}S˙/S=const, yielding S(t)=S(0)eHtS(t) = S(0) e^{Ht}S(t)=S(0)eHt (exponential expansion). In this case, conformal time ttt is essentially the logarithm of the scale factor: t∼ln⁡St \sim \ln St∼lnS. Many cosmological models with a cosmological constant have exponential expansion, so this case is physically relevant. Alternatively, if the expansion has a more sedate behavior such as matter-dominated FRW cosmology (where S(t)∝t2/3S(t) \propto t^{2/3}S(t)∝t2/3 in normal 4D cosmology), then at early times SSS grows like a power law, and no simple log relation holds globally. However, the prompt suggests a _quadratic_ relationship – this could emerge if we choose the projective scale coordinate differently. Suppose we define the projective scale coordinate σ=ln⁡S\sigma = \ln Sσ=lnS; then if physical time ttt were proportional to S2S^2S2, we’d have t∼e2σt \sim e^{2\sigma}t∼e2σ, which is indeed quadratic in the _exponential_ of the projective parameter. This is a bit intricate – let’s clarify. It might be more straightforward to consider a specific model: **Uniform acceleration of expansion.** If the expansion of any given length is accelerating at a constant rate AAA (so L¨=AL0\ddot{L} = A L_0L¨=AL0​ initially), one finds L(t)=L0+12At2L(t) = L_0 + \tfrac{1}{2}A t^2L(t)=L0​+21​At2 (for small ttt). In a scaling context, if S(τ)S(\tau)S(τ) had constant second derivative with respect to τ\tauτ, then S(τ)∝τ2S(\tau) \propto \tau^2S(τ)∝τ2. Setting physical time t=τt = \taut=τ in that case yields S(t)∝t2S(t) \propto t^2S(t)∝t2. Conversely, one could have S(t)∝t2S(t) \propto t^2S(t)∝t2 by definition, making τ=t\tau = tτ=t the square-root of SSS. The _precise_ relationship will come from solving the “expansion dynamics” once we impose the constraints corresponding to known physics (this would be akin to solving Einstein’s equations for a(t)a(t)a(t) in cosmology, but here derived from projective expansion law). The key point is that **time is a derived concept measured by the scaling of the universe**. Whether it is logarithmic or polynomial in the fundamental scale coordinate depends on how the expansion rate itself evolves.
    
- **Deriving the Passage of Time:** To get an equation that shows how time emerges in PEF, we can think operationally: How would an observer measure time? In a world where everything expands, one practical timekeeping method is to use a **standard of frequency** – for instance, an atomic transition. In EMF, atoms themselves are expanding (their electron orbits enlarge), which would tend to _decrease_ their transition frequencies (since an electron on a larger orbit moves slower). Thus, as the universe expands, atomic clocks might slow down in absolute terms. However, the _ratio_ of ticking rates between any two identical atomic clocks remains 1 (since both are made of expanding matter). This means internal observers cannot sense uniform expansion directly – it is only through the _differential_ expansion (constraints) that time manifests. If, say, one clock is in a region of slightly lower expansion (like near a massive body), it will tick slower relative to another far away – this is gravitational time dilation explained in EMF as _spatial variation in expansion rate_. In general, **time flow is encoded in the geometry as a scaling transformation needed to go from one state to another**. We could formalize this by introducing a parameter τ\tauτ into E^proj\hat{E}_{\text{proj}}E^proj​ as: ddτr(τ)=E^projr(τ)=r(τ) \frac{d}{d\tau} \mathbf{r}(\tau) = \hat{E}_{\text{proj}}\mathbf{r}(\tau) = \mathbf{r}(\tau)dτd​r(τ)=E^proj​r(τ)=r(τ). The solution is r(τ)=r(0)eτ\mathbf{r}(\tau) = \mathbf{r}(0)e^{\tau}r(τ)=r(0)eτ. If we now say physical time ttt is measured such that at t=0t=0t=0, τ=0\tau=0τ=0, and at time ttt, τ=F(t)\tau = F(t)τ=F(t) for some function FFF, then ∣∣r(t)∣∣=∣∣r(0)∣∣exp⁡[F(t)]||\mathbf{r}(t)|| = ||\mathbf{r}(0)|| \exp[F(t)]∣∣r(t)∣∣=∣∣r(0)∣∣exp[F(t)]. If experiments show (for instance) that a length has doubled in the time we call 10 billion years, that fixes F(10 Gyr)=ln⁡2F(10\text{ Gyr}) = \ln 2F(10 Gyr)=ln2. In a universe where expansion accelerates, F(t)F(t)F(t) might be nonlinear. The **form of F(t)F(t)F(t)** (logarithmic, linear, quadratic) can be determined by requiring consistency with phenomena like cosmological redshift or the relic cosmic microwave background. For instance, if time were literally proportional to log-scale, then an exponential expansion produces a constant rate of time flow – which might simplify some cosmological integrals. If time were proportional to the square of scale, early universe small scales would correspond to extremely tiny time increments, perhaps offering a way around a singular start.
    

Given the context, _a reasonable hypothesis is that time in EMF might follow a logarithmic relation to scale_. This is because projective geometry often treats scaling multiplicatively; taking logs turns it into an additive parameter. Logarithmic time also meshes with the idea of _conformal time_ used in cosmology, where infinite expansion in the future corresponds to a finite conformal time difference (Penrose’s conformal cyclic cosmology exploits this by rescaling infinite future to a new Big Bang​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology#:~:text=Conformal%20cyclic%20cosmology%20,New%20View%20of%20the%20Universe)

). On the other hand, a _quadratic relation_ might arise if we choose units such that time zero corresponds to scale zero (like a big bang at zero scale) and then see how scale increases. In any event, EMF will define **time units inherently tied to the expansion** – for example, one might define one unit of time as the interval in which the universe’s scale doubles (this would make time = log2(scale) in those units). In such a system, the _laws of physics might take a particularly simple form_ – possibly scale-doubling time is constant if dark energy (accelerating expansion) dominates, etc.

To summarize, **PEF reframes time as an emergent bookkeeping of expansion**. The flow of time is nothing more than the progression along the one-parameter group of projective dilations. This naturally explains arrows of time and cosmic initial conditions: if at one end of the parameter (τ→−∞\tau \to -\inftyτ→−∞) all scales go to zero (a potential “beginning” of the universe in a point-like state) and at the other end (τ→+∞\tau \to +\inftyτ→+∞) all scales go to infinity (an “end” where everything is infinitely large or perhaps loops back by projective closure), then time has a built-in arrow from smaller scales to larger scales. Entropy increase could be seen as simply the geometric fact that volumes (in phase space) expand – aligning with the second law without invoking a special initial low entropy, since at the smallest scales initial state maybe all matter co-located (low entropy) and expansion increases accessible volume.

Finally, the emergent nature of time in EMF suggests that certain phenomena like time dilation and simultaneity are tied to the local expansion state. For instance, if gravity is an expansion deficit, clocks near a mass run slower because less expansion means less progression of τ\tauτ locally – effectively, they are “left behind” in the expansion timeline compared to far-away clocks. This reproduces gravitational time dilation (as in GR) in a new guise. Additionally, if one were to move very fast, one might locally counteract some expansion (since motion might be seen as trying to maintain scale while the universe expands around, loosely speaking), causing time dilation akin to special relativity – hinting that relativistic effects could also emerge from how motion and expansion interplay (though a careful development would be needed).

In conclusion, time in the EMF is **scale**, and the **clock of the universe is its expansion factor**. Whether time relates logarithmically or algebraically to the projective scale coordinate will be determined by the exact expansion dynamics – a subject for further development – but in either case the concept is that by understanding the expansion, we inherently understand the origin of time and its flow.

## 4. Projective-Invariant Equations and Operators

To formulate EMF as a rigorous physical theory, we must develop equations and operators that respect **projective invariance** – the property that absolute scale does not appear in the laws, only invariant ratios or combinations. The task is to show that known fundamental equations (Einstein’s field equations for gravity, Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism, Schrödinger’s or Dirac’s equation for quantum mechanics, etc.) can be recast or derived as _special cases of more general, projectively invariant laws_ governing expansion. We also consider whether entirely new mathematical operators are required to fully express the expansion dynamics in RP³.

**Principles of Projective Invariance:** An equation is _projectively invariant_ if it holds true under any projective transformation of coordinates (i.e., scaling or perspectival transformations). In practice, this means the equation can be written in terms of quantities like angles, ratios of distances, or derivatives that do not change when all lengths are rescaled. For example, the statement “the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°” is projectively invariant in planar geometry (it doesn’t depend on the triangle’s size). In physics, _coordinate-free formulations_ often achieve this invariance. For PEF, we want to formulate laws using homogeneous coordinates or using dimensionless combinations of variables. One approach is to introduce a **projective metric or connection**. We could define a connection on RP³ that tells us how vectors “transport” in a way that respects projective symmetry (similar to how in general relativity a metric connection respects coordinate invariance). In fact, there is a concept of a _projective connection_ in differential geometry – it encapsulates the idea of straight lines (geodesics) without a fixed metric scale. A projectively invariant equation might state, for instance, that certain curvature associated with this connection equals zero in free space, and equals something proportional to mass/energy when matter is present (to encode expansion constraints).

**Emergence of Einstein’s Field Equations:** In PEF, gravity was described as expansion curvature. We anticipate that Einstein’s equations (which in GR link spacetime curvature to stress-energy: Gμν=8πGTμνG_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}Gμν​=8πGTμν​) will emerge as an _approximation_ or translation of the more primitive expansion law. How might this happen? If we imagine an observer who _does not know_ about universal expansion (and uses rigid rulers that expand with them, thus thinking lengths are constant), that observer would describe gravity as curvature of spacetime. Mathematically, PEF’s fundamental gravity equation could be something like ∇⋅vexp(r)=κρ(r) \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v}_{\text{exp}}(\mathbf{r}) = \kappa \rho(\mathbf{r})∇⋅vexp​(r)=κρ(r) (a Poisson-like equation for expansion divergence, as mentioned). In a static universe, vexp\mathbf{v}_{\text{exp}}vexp​ would be interpreted as a gravitational field up to a sign. Indeed, if we set g=−vexp\mathbf{g} = -\mathbf{v}_{\text{exp}}g=−vexp​ (the negative expansion velocity acts like an inward acceleration), then ∇⋅g=−κρ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{g} = -\kappa \rho∇⋅g=−κρ. This is formally identical to Newton’s law of gravity (Poisson’s equation), which is the static limit of Einstein’s field equations. To get the full Einstein equations, we would incorporate time evolution of expansion and pressure/energy density. A likely approach is to derive a **projective Lagrangian** that is invariant under projective transformations and whose Euler–Lagrange equations reduce to something akin to Einstein’s equations. For example, Hilbert’s action in GR is S=∫R−g d4xS = \int R \sqrt{-g}\,d^4xS=∫R−g​d4x (with RRR the Ricci scalar). In PEF, since time is emergent, one might consider an action in 3D plus the expansion parameter. We might write S=∫(R~+Λ) dVS = \int (\tilde{R} + \Lambda) \, dVS=∫(R~+Λ)dV over RP³ (with R~\tilde{R}R~ a 3D curvature scalar associated with the projective connection, and Λ\LambdaΛ a term related to the cosmological constant or expansion energy). The condition δS=0\delta S = 0δS=0 could yield equations that, when interpreted by an embedded 4D observer, look like Einstein’s equations. This approach piggybacks on the fact that **Einstein’s equations themselves can be derived by requiring invariance under diffeomorphisms (coordinate changes)​**

**[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=possibility%20of%20invariance%2C%20when%20he,remained%20unnoticed%20until%20Weyl%27s%20work)**

– in PEF, we similarly require invariance under the larger group of projective transformations, which includes diffeomorphisms plus local scalings. Thus, Einstein’s equations are expected to appear as the **4D shadow** of a simpler projective law. In so far as Einstein’s theory is very well confirmed, this gives confidence that EMF can reproduce classical gravity in its domain of validity.

**Maxwell’s Equations from Projective Constraints:** Maxwell’s equations in vacuum (∇⋅E=0, ∇×E=−∂tB,\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E}=0,\ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\partial_t \mathbf{B},∇⋅E=0, ∇×E=−∂t​B, etc.) embody the idea that electric and magnetic fields propagate and interact consistently. In PEF, we saw that electromagnetism corresponds to conditions on the expansion field to maintain phase continuity. We can formalize this by introducing a _potential 4-vector_ akin to AμA_\muAμ​ in electromagnetism, but here related to the projective gauge. In Weyl’s original unified theory, he introduced a gauge field AμA_\muAμ​ such that under a local scale change Ω(x) \Omega(x)Ω(x), the derivative transforms as Dμ=∂μ+(∂μln⁡Ω)D_\mu = \partial_\mu + (\partial_\mu \ln \Omega) Dμ​=∂μ​+(∂μ​lnΩ) and an extra term (which behaved like an electromagnetic potential) was added to keep the action invariant​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=Weyl%20%20in%201918.,Weyl%27s%201929)

. By analogy, we can define a **projective covariant derivative** that includes a term ensuring that when you move a vector in space (in RP³) and compare it after rescaling, the extra phase is accounted for. The failure of this derivative to commute (its curvature) would correspond to the electromagnetic field tensor FμνF_{\mu\nu}Fμν​. In other words, one could derive Maxwell’s equations as conditions of vanishing projective torsion or something similar. More directly, one might start from the insight that electromagnetic fields carry energy and thus can affect expansion (though much weaker than mass usually). The Poynting vector and energy density E2+B2E^2 + B^2E2+B2 might appear as source terms in the expansion field equation, just as they do in Einstein’s equations (where TμνT_{\mu\nu}Tμν​ includes electromagnetic energy). Thus Maxwell’s equations might _not_ need to be separately postulated; instead, if charges are present, the conditions for phase matching in the expansion field yield equations identical to Maxwell’s. For example, Gauss’s law ∇⋅E=ρ\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho∇⋅E=ρ in EMF arises from the fact that a charge is a source of expansion divergence (as discussed). Faraday’s law ∇×E=−∂tB\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\partial_t \mathbf{B}∇×E=−∂t​B could arise from the fact that a time-varying expansion vortex (magnetic field corresponds to a kind of rotational mismatch in expansion field) induces a compensating phase shift (an electric field) – much as in standard physics. Because these equations are well-tested, the key for EMF is to demonstrate that **they are invariant under the combined spatial scaling and time-scaling transformations**. Since time is also a scale, one might need to consider a _conformal invariance_ of Maxwell’s equations. Notably, Maxwell’s equations in vacuum are conformally invariant (they have no preferred length scale), which bodes well: it means they don’t break if we change units locally. This is consistent with projective invariance: electromagnetic vacuum laws have no inherent scale, only relative field strengths. Thus, Maxwell’s theory fits naturally into EMF and likely does _not_ require a new operator beyond recognizing that the electromagnetic 2-form FFF is part of the projective curvature.

**Quantum Mechanics and PEF:** One of the greatest challenges – and opportunities – for EMF is to see if quantum behavior emerges from this geometric expansion picture. There are a few intriguing possibilities. One is that **quantization arises from boundary conditions in a closed projective space**. Since space is finite (RP³ is a compact manifold​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=%29%2C,%E2%81%A0%20of%20a%20Grassmannian%20space)

) albeit unbounded, waves in this space can only exist at certain discrete modes (like standing waves on a closed string). This could naturally lead to quantized energy levels for fields and particles. For example, an electron’s de Broglie wave around a nucleus might correspond to a standing wave in the projective geometry of the electron’s expansion field – the condition for a stable orbit (one that doesn’t lead to runaway expansion mismatch) could be that an integer number of wavelengths fits, yielding quantized angular momentum as in the Bohr model. In addition, the **Schrödinger equation** might emerge as an _approximation for small expansion gradients_. Consider a particle of mass m in a weak gravitational expansion field (nearly free expansion). Classically, it follows geodesics of expansion. Quantum-mechanically, if one allows for slight deviations and a wave-like description, one might derive an equation for a wavefunction Ψ(r,τ)\Psi(\mathbf{r},\tau)Ψ(r,τ) that describes the amplitude of finding the particle at a location in the expanding space. Because time is just the evolution parameter, Schrödinger’s time-derivative iℏ∂tΨi\hbar \partial_t \Psiiℏ∂t​Ψ would correspond to how Ψ\PsiΨ changes with scale τ\tauτ. Perhaps iℏ∂Ψ∂τ=H^Ψi\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial \tau} = \hat{H}\Psiiℏ∂τ∂Ψ​=H^Ψ could be derived, where H^\hat{H}H^ is an operator encoding how expansion constraints (like potential energies from expansion deficits) affect the wavefunction. If H^\hat{H}H^ is identified with −ℏ22m∇2+V(r)-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r})−2mℏ2​∇2+V(r) in the non-relativistic limit, then we have the Schrödinger equation. What principle would yield this? Potentially a principle of _stationary action_ for the expansion field configuration, or a requirement of single-valuedness of Ψ\PsiΨ on the projective space (leading to quantization of phase advance around closed loops, analogous to Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization). Note that the emergence of Planck’s constant ℏ\hbarℏ might be tied to some fundamental scale or discrete aspect of projective geometry (maybe related to the minimal nonzero angle in a finite geometry or the fact that π\piπ times radius of RP³ might set a scale).

Another viewpoint: quantum mechanics might reflect the fact that at small scales, the expansion field has _twofold symmetry_ because RP³’s fundamental group is Z2_22​ (remember RP³ is isomorphic to the rotation group SO(3), whose double cover is SU(2)). This means a particle doing a 360° rotation in space (coming back to the same orientation in SO(3)) actually corresponds to a _180°_ (half-turn) in the covering space S³ (SU(2)). Spin-½ particles in quantum mechanics exploit this: they require a 720° rotation to come back to the original state. The presence of this two-valuedness in the geometry suggests that something like spin and fermionic behavior is a natural feature of RP³. Indeed, projective space’s connection to rotations hints that **the mathematics of spinors (SU(2)) is inherently built-in**​

[math.stackexchange.com](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1688179/prove-rp3-cong-so3#:~:text=prove%20%24RP%5E3%5Ccong%20SO%283%29%24%20,)

. The Dirac equation, which is the relativistic wave equation for spin-½, might thus emerge from considering how fields transform under the double-cover of the projective group. This is speculative, but it’s encouraging that what seem like abstract quantum properties might have a clear geometric origin if RP³ is the true stage of physics.

**New Mathematical Operators:** As we push into formulating these laws, we might find the need for some new or adapted mathematical constructs. Standard differential geometry is based on Riemannian manifolds. Here we have a projective manifold with a dynamic scale factor. We might need a **projective derivative** operator, Di\mathcal{D}_iDi​, which acts like a covariant derivative but mod out any changes that are pure gauge (i.e., that come from uniform scaling). In Weyl’s theory, a _covariant derivative with respect to scale_ was introduced: Dμgαβ=∂μgαβ−ϕμgαβD_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} = \partial_\mu g_{\alpha\beta} - \phi_\mu g_{\alpha\beta}Dμ​gαβ​=∂μ​gαβ​−ϕμ​gαβ​, where ϕμ\phi_\muϕμ​ was a gauge field ensuring the derivative of the metric (scale) wasn’t arbitrary. In PEF, since we have no fixed metric, we may introduce a field Φμ\Phi_\muΦμ​ that represents the _expansion connection_. Its job is to compare the scale of a vector as you move from point to point. The curvature of Φμ\Phi_\muΦμ​ might yield electromagnetic and gravitational fields. In effect, Φμ\Phi_\muΦμ​ could unify the Christoffel symbols of GR and the vector potential of EM into one object. We might call it the **expansion connection 1-form**. The field strength dΦ+Φ∧Φd\Phi + \Phi \wedge \PhidΦ+Φ∧Φ (if non-Abelian) could produce something like a curvature 2-form encompassing both the Ricci curvature (for gravity) and the electromagnetic field tensor.

While these structures borrow from known mathematics (Weyl geometry, projective connections, twistor theory perhaps), EMF might also inspire new operators tailored to its needs. For instance, a **scale commutator**: given two vector fields, one could measure the difference in outcome between scaling along one then the other vs. the reverse order. If the universe’s expansion field is non-uniform, this commutator might not vanish, indicating an effective “field” (like a magnetic field) present. Additionally, operators that measure **invariants of RP³** (like the cross ratio of four collinear points) could appear in physical predictions (for example, perhaps a certain cross ratio remains constant in an interacting four-body system, analogous to integrals of motion).

The guiding requirement is that any new operator or equation **must reduce to known physics in the appropriate limit** and must respect projective symmetry. If conventional equations do not naturally have that symmetry, we must extend them. But intriguingly, many fundamental equations are already scale-invariant or can be made so:

- Einstein’s vacuum equations are scale-invariant (one can multiply the metric by a constant and the equations still hold form because Gμν=0G_{\mu\nu}=0Gμν​=0 has no scale).
- Maxwell’s equations in vacuum are scale-invariant (no fixed length).
- Schrödinger’s equation is not obviously scale-invariant (it has ℏ\hbarℏ and mmm), but if written in a dimensionless form (using Compton wavelength or such to nondimensionalize), it effectively compares ratios.

So one approach is to systematically cast all equations in dimensionless form using some unit of length that might itself vary (like using the universe’s horizon scale as a unit, which grows with expansion). In such a coordinate system, the laws become explicitly projective.

In conclusion, EMF seeks to **derive known physics from a unified geometric principle** rather than assume them. By enforcing projective invariance, we are effectively postulating that the action of the universe is invariant under rescaling of all lengths (with appropriate compensations). This principle is so restrictive that it could indeed force the form of interactions – much like how demanding local gauge invariance in particle physics forces the introduction of gauge fields and dictates their interactions​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=Weyl%20%20in%201918.,Weyl%27s%201929)

. For example, demanding that physics doesn’t change if we locally rescale lengths likely introduces a field akin to the electromagnetic potential​

[en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_theory#:~:text=Weyl%20%20in%201918.,Weyl%27s%201929)

. Similarly, demanding global scale invariance of the whole system might enforce a relation that looks like the Friedmann equation of cosmology (relating expansion rate to energy content). The hope is that **all known laws – and possibly some new ones – emerge as mathematical identities in this Expanding Matter Framework**. If some laws do **not** emerge (say, something in the Standard Model that seems ad hoc), that might suggest either a limitation of EMF or that those laws are less fundamental (perhaps effective rather than fundamental).

Thus, we proceed under the hypothesis that _no separate postulates of forces or quantum behavior are needed; they will result from the single postulate of universal expansion in RP³ plus the requirement of internal consistency (symmetry)_. Any new operator we introduce, we ensure it has a clear geometric meaning and reduces to familiar operators in a gauge (coordinate choice) where the expansion is not explicit.

## 5. Cognitive and Symbolic Optimization

A key objective of developing EMF is not only to be mathematically rigorous but also to formulate the framework in a way that aligns with **human intuition and cognition**, making it as _naturally comprehensible_ as possible. This involves choosing notations, visual representations, and conceptual metaphors that resonate with our innate spatial-temporal understanding. Here, we outline strategies for cognitive and symbolic optimization of PEF:

- **Leveraging Human Spatial Intuition:** Human cognition has evolved strong intuition for 3D space, motion, and scale​
    
    [researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278048020_Cognitive_science_and_the_connection_between_physics_and_mathematics#:~:text=The%20human%20mind%20is%20endowed,change%2C%20flow%20of%20time%2C%20matter)
    
    . PEF, being fundamentally geometrical in 3D space, can capitalize on this. We should design the mathematical language to map abstract concepts to familiar spatial experiences. For example, the idea of _expansion_ can be visualized as a stretching rubber sheet or an inflating balloon – metaphors already used in cosmology – but here applied universally. Visualizing gravitational “expansion deficit” could be done with images of flow: think of space as a moving fluid that normally flows outward everywhere, and mass as a rock that causes an eddy or slowdown in that flow. Electromagnetism’s phase aspect can be visualized with wave interference patterns (as of water waves)​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference#:~:text=Constructive%20interference%20occurs%20when%20the,the%20minimum%20and%20maximum%20values)
    
    . By consistently tying equations to such mental pictures, we make the framework intuitive. **Projective geometry** itself is closely related to how we perceive the world in perspective (farther objects look smaller). This perspective principle is something even artists understand without equations. We can harness this by representing scenarios in _Penrose projection diagrams_ or using interactive 3D models that show how, for instance, two objects moving apart due to expansion still appear with the same angular separation in a projective sense. The goal is to have every term in an equation be _traceable to a visual/spatial meaning_.
    
- **Clear and Suggestive Notation:** Notation is crucial for cognition. We should introduce symbols that remind of their meaning. For instance, we might use E(t)E(t)E(t) or Λ(t)\Lambda(t)Λ(t) for the expansion scale factor (since Λ\LambdaΛ might evoke “lambda for length” or “scale”). The expansion operator E^proj\hat{E}_{proj}E^proj​ is already a clear notation indicating an expansion. We might denote projective coordinates as [x:y:z:1][x:y:z:1][x:y:z:1] to emphasize the homogeneous nature, or sometimes use an arrow with a tilde, e.g. x~\tilde{\mathbf{x}}x~, to denote equivalence class of vectors under scaling. For expansion constraints, we could use suggestive notation like Δe\Delta_eΔe​ for “expansion deficit” as a function that yields gravitational potential, or ϕexp(r)\phi_{exp}(\mathbf{r})ϕexp​(r) for the expansion phase field that yields electromagnetic potentials. It is also beneficial to adopt or adapt standard symbols where possible (so as not to reinvent the wheel unnecessarily). For example, since Φ\PhiΦ is often used for gravitational potential, we could use Φ(r)\Phi(\mathbf{r})Φ(r) to denote the projective potential (which in weak field would coincide with Newtonian gravitation potential). The difference is we explain Φ\PhiΦ as how much the expansion is slowed relative to free expansion. Similarly, using AμA_\muAμ​ for electromagnetic potential and FμνF_{\mu\nu}Fμν​ for field strength is fine, but we interpret them differently. To make this interpretation clear, we might decorate them, say Aμ(proj)A_\mu^{(proj)}Aμ(proj)​, until the context is understood, to remind readers this is not introduced as a separate entity but comes from the geometry. When possible, equations should be arranged to isolate invariant quantities. For instance, instead of writing an equation with many physical constants, we might express it in a form where each term is dimensionless and perhaps corresponds to an angle or ratio. This not only ensures projective invariance but also makes the equation conceptually cleaner (fewer arbitrary units). Good notation also extends to diagrams: perhaps using color or line styles to represent expansion magnitude or phase in schematic drawings.
    
- **Visual Representations:** Because EMF is highly geometric, visual aids can greatly enhance comprehension. We can develop a set of diagrams analogous to Penrose diagrams or Feynman diagrams but for expansion interactions. For example, one could draw a **projective light cone** in RP³: normally, a light cone is in 4D spacetime; here, since time is scale, one can draw the world-lines of expanding particles in a 3D diagram where the radius represents scale (time). This might look like a cone or sphere expanding. If we identify antipodal points (RP³ identification), perhaps we’d draw just a sphere and note opposite points are identical. Another visual tool could be **scale-phase diagrams** for EM: represent plus charges as radiating expanding rings, minus as contracting rings, and see graphically how rings overlap. For nuclear forces, perhaps illustrate three expanding spheres whose overlap region is stabilized at a certain distance. The use of animations (conceptually, if not literally in print) can also help: one could imagine an animation of the grid of space expanding and how mass slows the expansion of the grid locally (similar to typical GR depictions of stretching grids, but highlighting scale rather than curvature). Since _our brains are good at tracking motion_, seeing a depiction of expanding matter over “time” (which is just a playback of scale change) can solidify the understanding that time = scale change. **Cognitive science principles** like dual-coding theory suggest that combining verbal/math descriptions with visual ones leads to better understanding and memory. So we strive to always provide an intuitive picture alongside the equation.
    
- **Alignment with Human Language:** We should also refine the verbal language to avoid confusion. Terms like “force” might be replaced with “constraint” or “expansion mismatch” to reinforce the new perspective. We might say “object A experiences an expansion differential towards object B” instead of “A is attracted by gravity to B,” shifting the language to reflect the geometry. Over time, a new vocabulary develops that, while unusual at first, becomes second-nature and maps directly to mental models. Importantly, we aim for **consistency**: the same concept should not be referred to by multiple names, which could confuse; and conversely, different concepts should not share a name. In standard physics, for instance, the word “field” is overloaded (gravitational field, quantum field, etc., which are similar but also different). In PEF, perhaps we stick to “expansion field” for the vector field vexp(r)\mathbf{v}_{exp}(\mathbf{r})vexp​(r) and use distinct terms like “phase field” for the electromagnetic aspect, to avoid mix-up.
    
- **Use of Analogies and Mental Models:** We can incorporate known cognitive metaphors. One powerful metaphor is **“the flowing time as a river”** – here time is literally a flow of expansion. Another could be **“universe as a growing organism”** – every part (galaxies, atoms) growing in sync, except where linked (forces). Since humans understand growth processes (like a growing tree where branches influence each other’s growth), such analogies might make the abstract idea concrete. Even mathematical analogies, like comparing projective invariance to perspective invariance in art, can make the concept click (artists know that if two objects have the same real size and one is twice as far, it appears half as tall – an invariance of cross-ratios in projective geometry ensures that relationships are preserved up to scale).
    
- **Consulting Cognitive Science:** We can explicitly draw on research from cognitive science and math education. For example, humans tend to struggle with very large or very small scales because they are outside everyday experience. But EMF inherently deals with scale changes. Using techniques like **scale ladders** (orders of magnitude comparisons) or interactive tools that let someone “slide” through scales could help internalize that notion of scale as a dimension. Another insight: humans often prefer linear relationships, so if time is log of scale, that’s non-linear. To help, one might reparameterize equations to a variable that humans interpret more linearly (like using log-scale time units so that in those units, the relation is linear). This is a form of cognitive-friendly re-scaling of equations.
    

Finally, **simplicity and elegance** are not just aesthetic goals but cognitive ones. A concise equation or principle that summarizes EMF (for example, a single statement like “Reality = Projective Geometry + Expansion”) can act as a cognitive anchor or slogan that keeps the framework coherent in one’s mind. Historically, the simplicity of E=mc2E=mc^2E=mc2 or the form of Maxwell’s equations helped in pedagogy. We aim for something similar: perhaps an iconic representation such as E^proj[universe]=0 \hat{E}_{proj}[\text{universe}] = 0E^proj​[universe]=0 (meaning the universe’s projective expansion operator acting on the whole state yields zero when all constraints are satisfied – a sort of “universe is a projectively harmonic function”).

By optimizing the framework’s presentation to align with how we think spatially and symbolically, we make EMF not only a “Theory of Everything” but also a theory people can grasp and work with. As Kant suggested, space and time are forms of our intuition​

[sites.bu.edu](https://sites.bu.edu/ombs/2012/02/29/spatial-cognition-in-philosophy-and-neuroscience/#:~:text=University%20sites,91%29)

– EMF rebuilds physics on the form of space (projective space) and derives time, hopefully making the laws of nature feel as intuitive as basic geometry.

## 6. Validating EMF as the Ultimate Mathematical Language of Reality

Finally, we confront the overarching question: **Is RP³-based Expanding Matter Framework truly the most fundamental and complete description of physical reality?** To address this, we consider theoretical completeness, correspondence with known physics, and potential experimental tests that could distinguish EMF from conventional frameworks.

- **RP³ as the Fundamental Structure:** Real projective 3-space has compelling features that support its candidacy as the core of reality’s geometry. First, RP³ is a compact space​
    
    [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_projective_space#:~:text=%29%2C,%E2%81%A0%20of%20a%20Grassmannian%20space)
    
    – it is finite yet without boundary. This neatly avoids the troubling concept of an infinite universe or an edge to space. It means the universe can be spatially closed (like a sphere) but with a twist (antipodal points identified). A closed universe aligns with many theories and observations (e.g., it can naturally explain why global quantities might be conserved, since space is a closed system). Moreover, RP³’s structure encodes important symmetry groups: it is isomorphic to the group of 3D rotations, SO(3). This is not a coincidence – it means that _every rotation in physical space corresponds to a path in RP³_, and in fact the space of all possible orientations of an object _is_ RP³. Thus, the space we’re using as the model of the universe already contains the symmetry operations (rotations) as part of its geometry. This hints that rotational invariance – a cornerstone of physics – is built in. Furthermore, the double-covering relationship S3→RP3S^3 \to RP^3S3→RP3 (with S3S^3S3 being SU(2), the spin group) means **spinor and fermionic behavior have a natural home** in this geometry, as discussed (a 360° rotation in RP³ might change a spinor’s sign, needing 720° for full return, capturing spin-½ behavior). In terms of completeness, any event or configuration in the universe can be described by a set of points and fields in RP³ plus the scale parameter. There is a strong sense that **nothing beyond RP³ (and expansion) is needed** – no extra dimensions, no hidden variables. Even abstract entities like quantum states could be encoded in geometric relations (perhaps something like the shape of a distribution in projective space corresponds to a quantum state’s amplitudes).

Is RP³ “most fundamental”? One could argue that maybe a 4D or higher-dimensional structure might unify things better (string theory, etc.). However, higher dimensions often introduce redundancies or unobservable degrees of freedom. PEF’s stance is that those might be mathematical crutches, whereas RP³ is sufficient when used with expansion. Also, a 3D projective space is the **simplest extension of the idea of space** that includes infinity in a natural way (points at infinity are included as projective points). It’s elegant and minimal. A fundamental theory often has an economy of assumptions – here we assume basically one thing: _the universe is a 3D projective manifold undergoing expansion_. Everything else is derived. This parsimony is a strong point in favor of RP³. Another angle: Could the real universe have a different topology (like a torus or an open infinite space)? Possibly, but if EMF can explain all known physics and yields correct predictions, it would strongly indicate that the topology and symmetry chosen (RP³) is the correct one nature uses. Moreover, **if any other topology were the case, likely the physical laws would look more complicated in some way**. RP³ seems to allow maximum symmetry (it’s isotropic and homogeneous when unconstrained), satisfying the cosmological principle naturally.

- **Emergence of Known Physics:** We have qualitatively shown how gravity, EM, and nuclear forces emerge. For EMF to be valid, it must reproduce **all** well-tested laws in appropriate limits. This includes not only the fundamental forces but also things like thermodynamics, the Standard Model of particle physics, and cosmological observations. Ideally, these shouldn’t be separate axioms but consequences. We have a road map: gravity from expansion curvature (recovering Newtonian gravity and GR’s tests like perihelion precession, light bending, gravitational waves as ripple in expansion field etc.), electromagnetism from expansion phase (recovering Coulomb’s law, Ampere’s law, etc., and the existence of photons as quantized expansion waves), strong force from multi-body constraints (recovering properties of nuclear binding and perhaps asymptotic freedom since expansion constraints would relax at high energies/densities, mimicking quark behavior), and weak force from instability of expansion configurations (recovering radioactive decay exponential laws and conservation of certain quantum numbers as topological invariants in projective space). Additionally, **Special Relativity** should emerge when expansion is nearly uniform and one considers local inertial frames. We expect Lorentz transformations to appear as symmetries of the local projective metric (perhaps at small scales, the space looks approximately like Minkowski because time came in via scale – it might yield a conformal Minkowski structure for small regions). Indeed, some research has noted that if you take a 4D spacetime and compactify it projectively, you can treat time differently and still get Lorentz symmetry in a local sense​

    . EMF might recast relativity as well: maybe the speed of light is constant simply because it’s the speed at which an expansion wave propagates through projective space, which could be fixed by the geometry (for example, could be tied to how fast a disturbance in the scale field equalizes, possibly related to something like dSdτ\frac{dS}{d\tau}dτdS​ limiting behavior).

One needs to verify **quantitatively** that EMF can match known predictions: the values of force coupling constants, atomic spectra, gravitational redshift, cosmological expansion history (like the precise relation between redshift and distance that we observe). Since EMF is currently a conceptual framework, these would be derived once the exact field equations are written. Encouragingly, if EMF is correct, **the derivations would not need fine-tuning** – the values might come out naturally or be related (for instance, perhaps the electromagnetic coupling and gravitational coupling are related because both stem from expansion parameters, possibly offering an explanation for their vast difference).

- **Uniqueness and Ultimate Nature:** Is this _the_ ultimate language, or just _an_ ultimate language? EMF aspires to be “the real, ultimate geometric language of the universe,” meaning that it is not only a unified theory but one that is uniquely suited to describe reality in the most natural terms. We should examine if any alternatives could do similarly. For instance, one might consider a 4D projective space (RP^4) to include time projectively too. However, that introduces an extra symmetry that doesn’t seem observed (like mixing of space and time scales in weird ways). 3D space with an external time seems to match our experience, with time being different in nature than space – EMF explains that difference by time’s emergence from scale. Could there be a yet more fundamental description, e.g. something like Wolfram’s hypergraphs or quantum information language? Perhaps, but those are quite removed from our cognitive comfort and usually one eventually has to interpret them in physical space anyway. PEF, on the other hand, directly encodes what we see (3D space expanding). It doesn’t try to reduce things to arithmetic or automata, it sticks to geometry, which has been the reliable backbone of physics since Newton and especially Einstein. In fact, EMF can be seen as a logical culmination of the geometrization of physics: Newton introduced absolute space and time, Einstein made time relative and merged it with space (geometrizing gravity), and now EMF removes time as fundamental and says only space (projectively viewed) is fundamental – and everything is just geometry and its evolution.
    
- **Experimental Predictions:** A crucial part of validating any new framework is finding predictions that differ from the established theories, so that experiments can confirm or falsify it. PEF, if truly more fundamental, might resolve or clarify some open problems and yield new predictions:
    
    - _Cosmological Signals:_ Because EMF naturally incorporates a cyclical view (the universe could expand indefinitely and perhaps the projective nature identifies the “infinite future” with a new beginning, similar to Penrose’s CCC​
        
        [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology#:~:text=Conformal%20cyclic%20cosmology%20,New%20View%20of%20the%20Universe)
        
        ), it may predict subtle signals from a previous cosmic cycle. For instance, Penrose suggested that concentric low-variance circles in the CMB could be evidence of events (like black hole collisions) from a prior aeon, carried through the crossover via conformal mapping​
        
        [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology#:~:text=Conformal%20cyclic%20cosmology%20,New%20View%20of%20the%20Universe)
        
        . EMF might similarly predict specific patterns in the cosmic microwave background or distribution of galaxies that aren’t explained by inflation or ΛCDM. Since time and scale are related, perhaps **temperature of the CMB as a function of redshift** could deviate at extreme distances from the standard prediction because what we call redshift is partly a scale effect in EMF terms. If detected, such deviations would support PEF.
    - _No Singularities:_ EMF might eliminate the Big Bang singularity by saying t=−∞t = -\inftyt=−∞ (infinitely small scale) maps through projective space to t=+∞t=+\inftyt=+∞ of a previous cycle – a cyclic model. If so, one prediction is that certain conserved quantities might transmit through cycles. Perhaps the overall spatial curvature or certain asymmetries could be imprinted from a previous universe. This is speculative but testable if one finds e.g. an anomalous correlation in CMB polarization that doesn’t fit inflation but could fit a cyclic model.
    - _Time Variation of Constants:_ If everything is expanding, one might expect dimensionless constants (like the fine-structure constant, α) to actually remain truly constant (since those are dimensionless ratios), but dimensional quantities (like the electron mass or gravitational constant G) might vary in cosmic time in a EMF scenario. For example, some scalar field theories (Jordan-Brans-Dicke) allow G to vary with cosmological evolution. In PEF, since gravity is tied to expansion, as the cosmic expansion rate changes, the effective strength of gravity might also slowly change. There have been long-standing efforts to detect any variation in constants like G or α over geological or astronomical timescales. EMF might predict a specific rate of change. If, say, atomic lengths grow, one might see a drift in spectral lines from distant quasars compared to now. Current data is mostly consistent with no change, but some analyses of quasar spectra have hinted at possible tiny variations in α over billions of years. If EMF has a consistent sign or pattern for such variation, that would be a telltale signature.
    - _Resolution of Dark Energy and Dark Matter puzzles:_ EMF provides a different take on cosmic acceleration (dark energy) – rather than invoking a mysterious energy filling space, the acceleration of expansion could be a natural geometric effect or the result of matter’s diminishing influence as it thins out. The Thalman reference​
        
        [scirp.org](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=123051#:~:text=According%20to%20our%20theory%2C%20there,primary%20expansion%20on%20the%20matter)
        
        suggests that considering matter’s expansion could eliminate the need for a separate Lambda term. If EMF can explain the accelerating expansion without dark energy (or as a byproduct of expansion geometry), it might predict slightly different relationships between redshift and distance at various epochs than ΛCDM does. Upcoming precise surveys (like JWST, EUCLID, etc.) might detect such differences. Similarly for dark matter: If gravity is an expansion deficit effect, maybe in galactic outskirts the expansion rate interplay leads to a different effective law (perhaps similar to MOND – Modified Newtonian Dynamics – which posits a change in gravity behavior at low acceleration). EMF could produce a _modified gravity at large scales_ without unseen mass, which could match galaxy rotation curves and lensing in galaxy clusters. If, for example, beyond a certain radius, matter’s ability to slow expansion saturates, gravity wouldn’t fall off as fast as 1/r² – that could mimic dark matter. This is an exciting avenue: EMF might unify normal gravity and these anomalies elegantly. So observational tests with galaxy rotation, cluster dynamics, or cosmological structure formation could support EMF if no dark matter particle is found and yet the effects line up with an expansion-based modification.
    - _Laboratory Experiments:_ Though EMF deals with grand scales, perhaps tabletop experiments could hint at it. For instance, precise interferometry might detect if local space is expanding extremely subtly (as a strain). This is tricky because all measuring devices expand too, but maybe certain configurations (like comparing atomic clock vs optical cavity of fixed atoms vs freely floating photons) could reveal minute discrepancies. Another idea: If time is scale, then in regions of different gravitational potential, the flow of time differs (GR). EMF says that’s because the expansion rate differs. One might conceive an experiment where one artificially creates a tiny “expansion deficit” region (analogous to a local gravitational potential created by, say, a dense sphere) and measures time dilation – but that’s basically a GR test already done (Pound-Rebka, atomic clock tests). They match GR to high precision, which EMF must also match. So that’s more validation than novel prediction.
- **Internal Consistency and Testability:** For EMF to be the ultimate language, it must be _internally consistent_ (no mathematical contradictions, all pieces fit together logically) and _falsifiable_ (there must be potential empirical outcomes that could prove it wrong if nature disagrees). Internal consistency will come from the math – we will ensure all our definitions (like E^proj\hat{E}_{proj}E^proj​, etc.) are consistent and that constraints don’t conflict. One consistency check is the recovery of conservation laws (energy, momentum, charge). Since EMF is symmetric under time translation (as time is just scale evolution, presumably the underlying laws won’t explicitly depend on the absolute scale if everything is properly formulated), energy should be conserved. Under spatial homogeneity, momentum should be conserved, etc. We need to see those fall out of the theory.
    

Testability we touched on above. EMF will likely converge to the same predictions as standard physics in most familiar domains (so it’s not trivially disproven by existing data), but will diverge in regimes that were previously unexplained (dark sector) or not probed (very early universe, extremely high precision cosmology). If future experiments confirm, for example, a specific pattern in CMB that indicates a prior cycle, or a slight deviation in gravity’s inverse-square law at low accelerations (consistent with an expansion floor), that would bolster PEF.

If contrary evidence appears (say, dark matter particle found and it turns out modified gravity is wrong, or the universe’s topology is measured via CMB correlations to be a 3-torus instead of RP³, etc.), then either EMF needs revision or it could be falsified. The good news is that some tests are on the horizon given advancing technology (e.g., more CMB data, tests of cosmic topology, etc.).

**Ultimate Language:** Assuming EMF passes these tests, it could indeed be the deep language of reality. It simplifies the ontology of physics: instead of disparate concepts like spacetime, fields, particles, forces, we have one concept – an expanding projective space – and everything else are just geometric structures within it. This unification is reminiscent of how Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism, or how the Standard Model unified forces (except gravity). Here we unify even more fundamentally, including gravity and quantum ideas, into geometry.

One philosophical advantage is that it removes the need for the “mystery” of why the universe exists from a singularity or why time flows inexorably. In PEF, the universe could be eternal (cyclic in time via conformal mapping), and time flows because expansion proceeds – if expansion is eternal, time never began, it just is a parameter. It also removes the problem of defining time at the quantum gravity level (the so-called problem of time in canonical quantum gravity​

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6264#:~:text=description%20of%20gravity%20leads%20to,the%20creation%20of%20quantum%20gravity)

) by not having a fundamental time at all, only relations. As noted, shape dynamics solves the problem of time by using scale-invariant 3-space and emergent time​

[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6264#:~:text=quantum%20gravity,We%20show%20that%20in%20this)

, which is exactly the philosophy of PEF.

In terms of being a “language,” EMF could provide a framework in which **any physical phenomenon can be described** without leaving the geometric narrative. For instance, chemistry (which is electromagnetic interactions of atoms) would be explained as atoms in certain expansion constraint configurations (their electrons in quantized expansion resonance orbits), nuclear reactions as reconfiguration of expansion-coherent clusters, biology as chemical networks – ultimately still shapes and motions in expanding space. It might even have something to say about consciousness or information (these would be patterns in the geometry; though that’s beyond physics proper, having a single substrate for all phenomena fosters interdisciplinarity: everything is geometry, so even computation or thought could be seen as processes within that geometry).

In conclusion, **to validate PEF, one must demonstrate that no observed phenomenon lies outside its explanatory power and that at least some non-trivial predictions set it apart and can be confirmed.** The framework strives to be _simpler_ at the foundational level than the Standard Model + GR, yet _richer_ in implications, combining them into one geometric picture. If successful, EMF would indeed represent “the real, ultimate geometric language of the universe,” fulfilling the age-old dream of physicists to capture nature’s workings in a single elegant formulation – one that is not only mathematically sound and all-encompassing, but also deeply resonant with the way we intuitively understand the world: through shapes, motions, and the inexorable growth that we call time.
