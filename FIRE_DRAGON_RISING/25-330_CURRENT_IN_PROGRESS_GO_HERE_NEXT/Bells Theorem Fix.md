On Expansion and the End of Bell’s Paradox

Physics (2025), to be submitted

Quantum correlations look impossible only if you start by assuming nothing connects what looks far apart; once you admit expansion makes distance a lie, they’re obvious and local.

1. The Setup Nobody Questions  
    Picture two lumps on a balloon. You call them distant, but they’re not—they’re the same rubber. Squeeze one, the other moves. No signal, no spook. That’s it.
2. Where Bell Gets Stuck  
    Bell said: if each lump had its own private rulebook—no peeking, no talking—then the best match-up you could get, averaged over four random squeezes, is 75 %. He wrote one line of math and proved it. We measure 85 %.
3. The Fix  
    There are no private rulebooks. The rulebook is the rubber. It was never cut. Expansion wrote the answers before the lumps ever looked separate. Distance is the illusion; the sheet is the reality.
4. The Inequality That Wasn’t  
    Bell’s cap only holds if you pretend the lumps were born alone. They weren’t. They were born together in a smaller balloon, then stretched. The 85 % isn’t a violation—it’s the signature of a single surface.
5. What Experiments Actually Show  
    Every click we count is just the rubber settling into its next shape. No collapse, no faster-than-light, no hidden variables. Just geometry doing its job.
6. Conclusion  
    Bell asked the right question with the wrong map. He drew islands. The universe is a balloon. The paradox ends the moment you stop pretending things were ever apart.

No equations. No apologies.
