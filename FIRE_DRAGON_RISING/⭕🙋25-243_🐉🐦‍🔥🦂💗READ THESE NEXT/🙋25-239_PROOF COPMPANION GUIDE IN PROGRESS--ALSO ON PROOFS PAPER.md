Companion Guide to the Proofs on Expanding Matter (Appendices A–N)

This packet starts from a world with no built‑in distances or angles. It works with two ways to measure any region: how much material it contains and how much room it takes up. From that starting point it identifies the natural geometric setting, builds an invariant that can be computed from volumes, shows how a simple refinement rule forces discrete values at any finite stage, and proves when and how variation and rotation appear. It also shows why round spheres are selected under pressure, why certain discrete states are stable at finite depth, and why four independent kinds of control are required for robust stability.

Appendix A. Uniqueness of density as a local scalar

This appendix establishes that density is the only local number you can fairly attach to a point using just the two totals inside small regions, provided your rule ignores the shape of the region and does not change when you scale the region up or down. Any other acceptable local scalar is simply a continuous re‑labeling of density. In short, once you decide to work only with “how much stuff” and “how much room,” density is the sole local ingredient.

Appendix B. Identifying the ambient space by incidence alone

This appendix fixes the geometric backdrop without introducing rulers or angles. If you require only the basic facts about how points, lines, and planes fit together, and you impose those facts on a connected three‑dimensional space in a way that is compatible with its topology, you are forced into real projective three‑dimensional space. That is the setting where straightness and alignment make sense while distances and angles are not assumed.

Appendix B.A. A volumetric form of the cross‑ratio

This appendix defines the volumetric cross‑ratio as a ratio of four tetrahedral volumes. The tetrahedra are formed from two auxiliary points that lie off the line, together with the four points on the line taken in pairs. The appendix proves that this ratio does not depend on which lifts or auxiliary points you chose, remains unchanged under every projective transformation, and agrees exactly with the classical cross‑ratio of the four points on the line. The point is that the invariant can be computed purely from volume comparisons.

Appendix C. Variation appears exactly when expansion is uneven

Starting from a uniform state, density remains constant if the measure of “room” evolves as a single overall factor everywhere. Density becomes non‑constant exactly when that evolution is not the same from place to place. Put simply, differentiation in space occurs if and only if expansion is non‑uniform relative to the transport of material.

Appendix D. Uniform volumetric expansion is impossible on a closed space

On a compact three‑dimensional space without boundary, a truly uniform rate of change of volume must vanish. If any change in the extent measure occurs, it cannot be spatially uniform. This pairs with the previous appendix: whenever there is any nonzero change, it is necessarily uneven, and that is exactly what produces spatial differentiation.

Appendix E. How rotation can be created from an initially non‑rotating state

When density varies and pressure depends on more than density alone, the directions of the density gradient and the pressure gradient need not align. Their misalignment supplies a source of rotation. The appendix writes this source term explicitly and shows that, even if the flow starts without rotation, rotation appears immediately once those gradients fail to point in the same direction. This is a precise statement of how uneven stretching, together with a non‑trivial material law, can create swirl from rest.

Appendix F. Why a round sphere is selected and remains stable under a pressure jump

Consider an inclusion of denser material inside a lighter background, with positive surface tension and a steady pressure difference across the interface. Among all embedded smooth shapes that enclose the same volume, the only one with constant mean curvature everywhere is the round sphere. The appendix shows that the sphere is not only a critical shape but also a strict local minimum of the free energy. In practice, an inclusion relaxes toward a sphere and resists small deformations while the pressure difference persists.

Appendix G. Finite refinement along a line yields only rational values

There is a natural way to refine neighboring points along a line by inserting the simplest in‑between value, the mediant. If you repeat this across all neighboring pairs for a finite number of steps, every value you produce is a rational number in lowest terms. Every positive rational number appears at some finite stage, while irrational values can be reached only as infinite limits. This shows that finite refinement produces a discrete spectrum.


WHERE  YOU LEFT OFF
Appendix H. The refinement rule is uniquely forced by invariance

If you require that the refinement of a neighboring pair preserve the volume‑based invariant and behave well under projective transformations, there is a unique elementary refinement. In coordinates it is the mediant insertion. This means the refinement rule is not an extra assumption but a consequence of the invariance you have already fixed.

Appendix I. Aiming at a target picks out its best fractions

Choose a real target number between two neighbors and keep refining only on the side that still brackets the target. The fractions that appear are exactly the best rational approximations to the target from its continued‑fraction expansion. For the golden number, these are the Fibonacci ratios. For one plus the square root of two, these are the Pell ratios. The appendix gives the simple update rules and identifies the resulting fractions.

Appendix J. “Resonance” equals best rational approximation

Among all fractions with denominators up to a given bound, the ones that minimize the error to a fixed real target are exactly the convergents from its continued‑fraction expansion and the immediate in‑between fractions at each stage. The appendix proves this error statement and shows that the refinement process you are using produces precisely those same fractions and no others at finite steps.

Appendix K. The rational spectrum for two gauges

If you designate two target values, such as the golden number and one plus the square root of two, and collect all fractions produced by the refinement toward either target, you get the union of the Fibonacci ladder and the Pell ladder together with their neighboring in‑between fractions. Truncating the process at a finite depth makes this a finite set. Letting the depth grow recovers the targets as limits while remaining discrete at every finite stage.

Appendix L. A supporting second‑order operator in the projective setting

There exists a unique, up to an overall factor, second‑order differential operator on the natural projective density bundle that is compatible with projective symmetries and has the identity as its leading part. In an ordinary coordinate chart it becomes one fifth of the usual Laplacian. This operator serves as a tool for building quadratic energies in a way that respects the projective structure; it is not the main headline of the packet.

Appendix M. Finite‑age stability and the discrete list of stable states

Define a simple, scale‑free error that rates how well a fraction approximates a chosen target, with a penalty that grows like the square of the denominator. Over all denominators up to a fixed bound, the strict local minimizers of this error are exactly the convergents of the target’s continued fraction. With the two chosen targets, this picks out a specific finite list of “stable ages” within one seat. The appendix gives the concrete list that occurs under the stated bound.

Appendix M.A. The first reset and its index

Imposing a no‑flux boundary condition on a spherical seat selects the first allowable radial node of the spherically symmetric mode. That node lies between the stable ages numbered eighty‑nine and one hundred forty‑four. By the construction of the seat, the reset index is therefore ninety. This ties a continuous boundary condition to the discrete list from the previous appendix.

Appendix N. Four independent sectors are required for robust stability

Small deviations from a sphere split into four independent kinds: a global change of size, low‑order shape changes such as squashing and stretching, high‑frequency ripples, and tangential twisting along the surface. If any one of these sectors is left uncontrolled, there is either an actual instability or a neutral direction. When each sector carries a positive weight, the quadratic energy is coercive after removing rigid motions, which means the sphere is genuinely stable against all small perturbations.

Appendix P. Discrete minima persist and attract under perturbation

A strict local minimum of the energy does not disappear under small changes to the rules. It moves slightly and remains a strict local minimum. If you start close enough and move downhill according to the gradient, you converge exponentially to that minimum. This establishes that the discrete finite‑depth states are structurally stable and have genuine local basins of attraction.
