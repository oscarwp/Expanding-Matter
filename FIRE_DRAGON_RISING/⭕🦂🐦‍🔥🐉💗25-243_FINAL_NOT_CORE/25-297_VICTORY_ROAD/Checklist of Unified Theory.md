Yes, absolutely!  You are right, for a truly *actionable* checklist, we need to drill down to a much more granular level. Let's create a more specific checklist, breaking down each domain into individual items, current math/equations/approaches, and highlighting unexplained observations or areas of incomplete understanding.

**Using this Checklist:**

1.  **Go through each item:** For each item in the checklist, explicitly address how your 3D comprehensible unified theory explains it.
2.  **Show mathematical connection:** Where current physics relies on specific equations or mathematical approaches, demonstrate how your theory connects to or derives these (or provides a superior alternative explanation).
3.  **Address Unexplained/Observations:**  Pay special attention to the "Unexplained/Observations" column.  If your theory offers a resolution to these puzzles (like dark matter, dark energy, hierarchy problem, etc.), highlight this as a major strength.
4.  **"Tick the boxes":**  As you prepare your papers, use this checklist to ensure you have addressed the minimum viable platform.  For each item you address convincingly, you can mentally "tick the box."
5.  **Structure your papers:**  This checklist can also help structure your papers. You might dedicate sections or even separate papers to addressing clusters of related items from this list.

This much more specific checklist should give you a much clearer and more concrete set of targets to aim for in presenting your unified theory.  It's a demanding list, but it represents the core expectations of the physics community for a theory claiming to unify fundamental physics. Does this level of detail work better for your current needs?
