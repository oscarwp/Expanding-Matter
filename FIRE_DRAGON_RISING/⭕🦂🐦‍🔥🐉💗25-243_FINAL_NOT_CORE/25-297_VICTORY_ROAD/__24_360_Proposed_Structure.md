Below is a **proposed structure** to help you organize **all** the interconnected ideas—papers, math approaches, thought experiments, narratives, etc.—without getting overwhelmed. Think of it like an **Information Architecture** or **blueprint**. You can tweak the details to fit your style, but the main goal is to have a system that’s **modular**, **scalable**, and **flexible** enough to capture all the expansions (pun intended) of your theory.

# 1. Overall Framework

## 1.1 The “Master Index”

- **Purpose**: A simple master list (or table of contents) that references every concept, paper, math tool, and sub-topic.
- **Format**:
    - One file (or top-level note) with links to sub-pages.
    - Organized by major categories (e.g., _Papers_, _Math Tools_, _Visual Thought Experiments_, _Narratives_, _Key Concepts_, _Current Physics Comparisons_).

**Why**: This ensures you always know where to put new ideas. Every time you come up with a new concept or see a new connection, you can update the Master Index so it never becomes a wild tangle.

---

## 1.2 Categories

1. **Papers / Projects**
    
    - Each major paper or project (like “Expanding Circles,” “Bohr’s Radius,” “Shape of the Universe,” etc.) gets its own sub-page.
    - **Within** those pages, you’ll store the relevant math references, narratives, thought experiments, references to existing physics, etc.
2. **Concept Pages**
    
    - Each concept (e.g., “Gravitational Lensing in EMF,” “Dark Energy as Expanding Fields,” “Resonance Patterns,” etc.) gets a short summary page.
    - If multiple projects reference the same concept, they can link back to this concept page.
    - **Subsections** on concept pages can describe:
        - The visual or thought experiment,
        - The relevant math approach,
        - Connections to existing physics,
        - Historical or personal origin of the idea.
3. **Math Tools & Approaches**
    
    - A section for: “3D Euclidean Approach,” “Projective Geometry,” “PGA,” “Differential Equations for Waves,” etc.
    - Each math tool or approach has its own sub-page explaining:
        - **When/Why** to use it (e.g., “Use plain 3D for small expansions,” “Use Projective Geometry for intersection logic,” etc.),
        - Example usage or a snippet of the relevant equations,
        - Links to real-world examples or your theoretical projects.
4. **Narratives / Thought Experiments**
    
    - Some pages will be more “story-like”: describing how you’d present a concept to a layperson or how you discovered it.
    - Keep these as **separate but linked** pages, so you don’t clutter the purely technical pages with big narrative text.
    - Example: “Story of Expanding Circles” (the intuitive journey you took).
5. **Current Physics / Math**
    
    - Pages that describe “Standard Relativity,” “Quantum Field Theory,” “Why current math is the way it is,” etc.
    - Each page can link to relevant EMF pages that show equivalences or alternative explanations.
    - This helps outsiders see: “Oh, they’re referencing conventional gravitational lensing _here_, but in EMF, it’s an expanding field overlap phenomenon,” etc.

# 2. Building the Architecture Step by Step

## 2.1 Start Small

1. **Pick One Project** (e.g., “Expanding Circles Paper”)
    
    - Create a page that outlines the main argument, sub-sections of the paper, essential math, key references, etc.
    - Link to smaller concept pages (like “EMF view of curvature,” “Why expansions unify matter and space”).
2. **Create or Reuse Relevant Concept Pages**
    
    - For instance, “Resonant Overlaps in EMF.” Write a short summary.
    - If later you realize you have a more general page called “Standing Waves and Expanding Fields,” consider merging or cross-linking.

## 2.2 Add the Math Tools

- **Math Tools Index**: A page listing each approach:
    
    - 3D Euclidean expansions,
    - Projective Geometry (PG),
    - Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA),
    - PDEs for waves, etc.
- For each tool:
    
    - **Describe**: “What does it do? Why do we need it? Example usage in the theory.”
    - **Example**: “For two expanding spheres with intersections, I used PG. For a complex set of transformations, I used PGA.”

## 2.3 Incorporate the Narratives and Thought Experiments

- **Narratives**:
    - “Origin story” of each big idea,
    - “Motivational story” for how to approach expansions,
    - “Thought experiment” pages (like imagining 2D circles in a hexagonal pattern, or the bowling ball on a rubber sheet analogy, etc.).
- Link each narrative to the concept or paper it best illuminates.

## 2.4 Cross-Link Everything in a Controlled Way

- Whenever you create or revise a page, ask: “Does this link to existing pages on math, concepts, or narratives?”
- This prevents a big hairball; you create **intentional** cross-links.

# 3. Putting It into Practice

## 3.1 A Concrete Example of How Pages Link

Imagine you create a “Gravitational Lensing in EMF” page. Inside it you have:

1. **Summary**: 1-2 paragraphs about how lensing emerges from expanding fields.
2. **Visual/Thought Experiment**: Link to a “Bowling Ball on Rubber Sheet” or “Expanding Circles in 2D” narrative page.
3. **Math Approach**: Link to “Projective Geometry Intersection Methods” page, because you use that to calculate how expansions bend or appear to bend paths of light.
4. **Compare to Standard Physics**: Link to “Relativity – Gravitational Lensing” page.
5. **Further Reading**: “Expanding Matter Universe Paper” if you’re referencing a formal write-up.

## 3.2 Using Obsidian or Another Tool

- Obsidian is great for linking notes. Once you have your top-level Master Index and these category-based pages, you can ensure everything stays navigable:
    
    - **Master Index** → “Gravitational Lensing in EMF” → “Bowling Ball Thought Experiment” → “PG Intersection Math.”
- If it gets unwieldy, you can add tags (#concept, #paper, #math, etc.) or a **folder** structure, but keep the cross-linking approach so you can jump among relevant ideas with ease.

# 4. Additional Tips

1. **Distinguish “Draft” vs. “Finalized”**:
    
    - Have a naming convention: “Draft – Gravitational Lensing in EMF” vs. “Final – Gravitational Lensing in EMF.”
    - This way you can safely play with structure without losing track of polished material.
2. **Curate a “Living Roadmap”**:
    
    - A separate note or doc describing which big areas you’re actively developing, which are stable, and which are “in the works.”
    - This helps you see the big picture at a glance.
3. **Modular, but Not Too Fragmented**:
    
    - Resist the urge to create 10 tiny pages for every small idea. Often it’s better to have a single concept page with subheadings.
    - Let your Master Index be an overview and keep concept pages _reasonably_ sized.
4. **Regularly Prune & Merge**:
    
    - If a concept page is only one paragraph, consider merging it into a larger, more general concept page.
    - If a page becomes unwieldy, split it into sub-pages (like “Intro to Projective Geometry” vs. “Advanced Projective Geometry Tactics”).

# 5. Conclusion and Next Steps

1. **Start with a Master Index**:
    
    - List your major papers/projects, concepts, math approaches, narratives, and comparisons to standard physics.
2. **Create/Populate Pages**:
    
    - For each big item, create a page with relevant sub-sections.
3. **Link and Cross-Reference**:
    
    - As you write, always ask, “What else does this connect to?” Link it.
4. **Iterate**:
    
    - This structure will evolve as your theory grows or clarifies. Keep refining.

By following this approach, you’ll have a **clear, top-level map** of your entire theory. You can present each component (math, concept, narrative) with minimal confusion, and easily point mathematicians or physicists to the exact part they’ll find relevant—be it the **“Projective Geometry Intersection Methods”** or the **“Origin of Expanding Circles Idea.”** It’s modular enough that you can reorganize or expand it any time, but stable enough that you won’t lose track of where each idea lives.
