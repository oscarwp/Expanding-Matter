# Literature Review: Scale-Dependent Metrics and Cross-Ratio Invariance under PGL(2,R)

## Projective Geometry and Invariant Distance Measures

**Lack of Scale-Independent Distance in Projective Geometry:** It is well-established that _projective geometry has no notion of a fixed distance or angle measure_ ([Projective geometry | Points, Lines & Planes | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/projective-geometry#:~:text=mathematicians%2C%20notably%20Jean,more%20advanced%20areas%20of%20mathematics)). Invariants in projective geometry are fundamentally different from those in Euclidean geometry – instead of distances or angles, one works with **incidence relations** and the **cross-ratio** of four collinear points ([Projective geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry#:~:text=After%20much%20work%20on%20the,hand%2C%20axiomatic%20studies%20revealed%20the)) ([Projective Geometry | Brilliant Math & Science Wiki](https://brilliant.org/wiki/projective-geometry/#:~:text=Projective%20Geometry%20,of%20distance%20or%20angle)). In fact, a classic result is that _no nontrivial metric (distance function) can remain invariant under the full projective group_. Formally, **there is no metric on** ℝP^n **invariant under the action of PGL(n,R)** ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=denoted%20by%20PGL%28n%2C%20R%29,we%20fix%20an%20appropriate%20quadric)). This is intuitive: the projective group PGL(2,R) acts _transitively_ on any ordered pair of distinct points on a line, meaning any two segments can be mapped onto any other – making a fixed distance value meaningless. Any putative “distance” preserved by all projective transformations would assign _equal distance to every pair of distinct points_, a clearly degenerate case. In summary, **a constant (scale-independent) distance function is fundamentally incompatible with full projective invariance**, as many authors have noted in discussions of projective geometry’s foundations ([Projective geometry | Points, Lines & Planes | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/projective-geometry#:~:text=mathematicians%2C%20notably%20Jean,more%20advanced%20areas%20of%20mathematics)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=denoted%20by%20PGL%28n%2C%20R%29,we%20fix%20an%20appropriate%20quadric)).

**Cross-Ratio as the Fundamental Invariant:** Instead of distance, the _cross-ratio_ serves as the key projective invariant on the line ([Projective geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry#:~:text=After%20much%20work%20on%20the,hand%2C%20axiomatic%20studies%20revealed%20the)). The cross-ratio of four collinear points (A, B; C, D) remains constant under PGL(2,R) transformations. However, a distance between two points cannot be expressed without reference to two additional benchmark points (to form a cross-ratio). Any distance defined via cross-ratios therefore _implicitly depends on a choice of reference scale_. For example, one could define a distance using two fixed reference points $P$ and $Q$ as $d(A,B) = \ln[(A,P;B,Q)]$ (log of cross-ratio), but under a general projective transformation $f\in PGL(2,R)$, the images of the reference points $f(P), f(Q)$ generally differ from $P, Q$, so the distance is not invariant unless one allows those reference points (hence the scale) to transform as well. This illustrates that a **“distance” derived from cross-ratios unavoidably inherits a scale-dependence**, tied to whatever defines the extra points or unit. Several classical constructions make this explicit:

- **Cayley–Klein Projective Metrics:** Cayley (1859) and Klein (1871) showed that by fixing a special _quadric (conic) “at infinity”_ in a projective plane (the so-called _absolute_), one can define a distance via a cross-ratio formula ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=degenerate%20conic%20can%20be%20thought,tangent%20line%20from%20that%20point)) ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=Klein%E2%80%99s%20work%20is%20based%20on,Note%20that%20this)). The resulting Cayley–Klein distance is _invariant only under those projective transformations that preserve the chosen quadric_. In other words, once a particular scale-defining conic is fixed, distance ratios (and angle measures) become well-defined and invariant under the _subgroup_ of PGL that fixes that structure. This is the basis of hyperbolic and elliptic metrics emerging from projective geometry. But the crucial point is that the absolute conic introduces an extra _scale element_; full PGL(2,R) no longer acts, only a subgroup (e.g. $PSL(2,\mathbb{R})$ for the unit disk model). Thus, Cayley–Klein metrics demonstrate that **to get a meaningful distance, one must break full projective freedom by introducing a scale-defining structure** (the conic), yielding invariance under a reduced symmetry group ([Projective geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry#:~:text=,in%20this%20case%20%20314)) ([Projective geometry - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_geometry#:~:text=Cayley%E2%80%93Klein%20metric%20%2C%20known%20to,1%2C%201)).
    
- **Hilbert’s Projective Metric:** In 1895, Hilbert constructed a distance function on any bounded convex domain in projective space. Given a convex set $K\subset \mathbb{RP}^n$, the **Hilbert metric** $d_H(P,Q)$ is defined using the cross-ratio of the four collinear points $(A,P;Q,B)$, where $A$ and $B$ are the intersections of line $PQ$ with the boundary $\partial K$. The distance is $d_H(P,Q)=\frac{1}{2}\ln [A,P;Q,B]$. Because this definition _uses cross-ratios of four points_ (with $A,B$ determined by $K$), it is **projectively invariant for any transformation that maps $K$ to itself** ([Volume entropy of Hilbert Geometries](https://hal.science/hal-00819143/document#:~:text=A%20Hilbert%20geometry%20is%20a,works%2C%20and%20of%20older%20ones)) ([[PDF] Hilbert metric, beyond convexity - Institut Fourier](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~will/GHD.pdf#:~:text=grenoble.fr%20%20Indeed%2C%20the%20cross,group%20%CE%93%20and%20%CE%A9)). In particular, if $f\in PGL(n+1,\R)$ and $f(K)=K$, then $d_H(f(P), f(Q)) = d_H(P,Q)$. Hilbert’s metric is thus a _scale-invariant distance within $K$_, but it _explicitly depends on the chosen domain $K$_. The domain’s boundary plays the role of a scale-setting reference (much like Cayley’s absolute). If $K$ is an ellipse (in $\mathbb{RP}^2$), Hilbert’s metric coincides with the standard hyperbolic distance (the Beltrami–Klein model) ([Volume entropy of Hilbert Geometries](https://hal.science/hal-00819143/document#:~:text=happens%20to%20be%20a%20complete,This%20last)). If $K$ is another shape, $d_H$ yields a Finsler metric peculiar to that domain ([Volume entropy of Hilbert Geometries](https://hal.science/hal-00819143/document#:~:text=straight%20lines,that%20among%20all%20finite%20dimensional)). The general lesson from Hilbert geometries is that **any intrinsic projective distance requires a dynamical or background scale** – here provided by $K$’s boundary – since _only cross-ratio combinations (involving four points) are truly projective-invariant_ ([Volume entropy of Hilbert Geometries](https://hal.science/hal-00819143/document#:~:text=A%20Hilbert%20geometry%20is%20a,works%2C%20and%20of%20older%20ones)). Without $K$ (i.e. on the entire projective line or space), no nontrivial distance can be defined.
    

In summary, prior literature in pure mathematics has explicitly or implicitly recognized that a _scale-independent two-point distance cannot be maintained under full PGL(2,R) symmetry_. **One must either introduce a fixed scale (breaking full projective symmetry) or allow the “metric” itself to change under transformations**. The latter case leads naturally to the idea of a _scale-dependent metric factor_, which we discuss next.

## Scale-Dependent Metric Factors in Geometry and Physics

**Weyl’s Gauge Geometry (1918):** The earliest explicit proposal of a scale-dependent metric structure in a geometric theory was Hermann **Weyl’s 1918 unified field theory** ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=,Lie%20Problem%20of%20Space) ). Weyl generalized Riemannian geometry by introducing a _point-dependent scale factor_ (a gauge field) that allows lengths to change from point to point. In Weyl geometry, the metric $g_{ij}(x)$ is not absolute; one can perform a local rescaling $g_{ij}\to \Omega^2(x),g_{ij}$ and correspondingly adjust the connection so that the geometry (especially the behavior of geodesics) is preserved ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=,Lie%20Problem%20of%20Space) ). Although Weyl’s motivation was different (unifying gravity and electromagnetism), he explicitly argued that _no truly invariant length scale exists a priori_ – only the _ratios_ of lengths along the same worldline could be compared, and even those could depend on the path unless an integrability condition is imposed ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=5%20Einstein%E2%80%99s%20objection%20Out%20of,But%20experience%2C%20objected%20Einstein)) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=the%20atoms%2C%20the%20chemical%20elements,6%20Final%20remarks)). Weyl’s theory thus embodies the idea that a “metric” requires a **scale field** $\sigma(x)$ (often expressed via a one-form $\varphi_i$ for length connection) to be consistent with extended symmetry (in his case, local scale invariance).

Notably, **Weyl’s insight mirrors the projective case**: if one demands invariance under a larger group than the isometries of a fixed metric, one is forced to make the metric _dynamic or path-dependent_. Under Weyl’s local scale symmetry, standard distances are not preserved – only if the scale field is pure gauge (gradient of a potential) can one gauge it away to recover a usual metric. Weyl’s theory was ultimately deemed unphysical by Einstein, **precisely because it predicted a scale-dependent effect**: the length of a rod or the rate of a clock would depend on its history in an electromagnetic field. Einstein’s famous objection noted that _identical atomic clocks moved along different paths would no longer agree_, leading to broadened spectral lines, which is not observed ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=is%20unfair%2C%20showing%20congruent%20dispacement,electromagnetic%29%20vicissitudes%20of%20the)) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=Vorgeschichte%20abhingen,nicht%20annehmbar%2C%20deren%20Tiefe%20und)). Einstein’s critique is historically important: it is an explicit recognition that if nature had a truly projective-like symmetry (or local scale symmetry), then **only a scale-dependent metric could accommodate it, but this would produce observable anomalies** (path-dependent frequency shifts) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=point%20will%20continue%20to%20run,clean%20spectral%20lines%20one%20sees)) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=Vorgeschichte%20abhingen,nicht%20annehmbar%2C%20deren%20Tiefe%20und)). Consequently, Weyl’s theory requires the scale field to be _integrable_ (a gradient) to avoid physical inconsistencies – which reduces it essentially to general relativity with an additional (non-dynamic) scalar field. This integrability condition removes the observable path-dependence, but at the cost of losing the general projective symmetry. The upshot is that Weyl identified the need for a metric scaling factor $\Sigma(x)$ (or $\lambda(x)$ in his notation) to reconcile extended symmetry with a length measure, even though a fully satisfactory physical theory along those lines was not achieved at the time.

**Projective Connections and Ehlers–Pirani–Schild (EPS) (1972):** In 1972, Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild revisited the foundational question of how metric structure can be deduced from more primitive geometric structures – specifically, the _projective structure_ of timelike geodesics and the _conformal structure_ of null geodesics in spacetime. Their influential paper “The Geometry of Free Fall and Light Propagation” demonstrated that if one knows only the **unparameterized paths** of free-fall trajectories (a projective structure on timelike worldlines) and the **light-cone structure** (a conformal structure for null directions), one cannot fix a unique metric – there remains an undetermined scale function. In modern terms, **they showed that a compatible projective and conformal structure yields a metric determined _up to a point-dependent scale factor_** ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=compatible%20conformal%20pseudo,a%20solution%20of%20the%20characteristic)). This remaining freedom is exactly a _Weyl (scale) gauge_. In other words, given data about which paths are geodesics (but not their parametrization) and which directions are lightlike, the spacetime metric $g_{ij}$ is recovered only up to $g_{ij}(x)\to \Omega^2(x),g_{ij}(x)$ ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)). EPS further argued that if one impos an extra condition (essentially, that clock rates can be normalized consistently – a _compatibility condition in the limit of null geodesics_), the scale factor must be constant, reducing the geometry to Riemannian (this is equivalent to Weyl’s scale field being integrable, leading to a global metric frame) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=But%20I%20find%20the%20emphasis,18%5D%2C%20p)). The important takeaway is that **EPS made explicit the necessity of a scale-dependent factor in going from projective geometry of worldlines to a true metric**. They noted that a spacetime with both a projective structure (from free-fall trajectories) and a conformal structure (from light) is naturally a **Weyl space** – a manifold with a metric defined up to a local scale factor ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=and%20Affine%20Structures%29,invariant)). Only by invoking physical considerations (like ideal clock synchronization) does one single out a specific scale (thereby choosing a gauge to get a Riemannian metric). Thus, EPS is a direct **proof of principle** that to maintain consistency with a full group of projective reparameterizations of geodesics, one must introduce a scalar factor $\Sigma(x)$ in the metric. This result, while couched in the context of spacetime geometry, is conceptually analogous to our claim in 1D: it shows that _affine parameter (scale of time) cannot be fixed by projective symmetry alone; an extra function is needed_. In EPS, the existence of this function is demonstrated and its necessity is derived from physical axioms.

**Contemporary and Other Mathematical Work:** The idea that two metrics with the same geodesics differ by a scaling is well known in differential geometry. For example, **projectively equivalent Riemannian metrics** (metrics that share the same unparameterized geodesics) are related by a scalar function. Classic results (dating back to Levi-Civita and Synge) show that if two metrics $g$ and $\tilde g$ have identical geodesic paths, then $\tilde g_{ij} = e^{2\phi(x)},g_{ij}$ for some function $\phi(x)$ (at least in regions where certain curvature obstructions vanish). Modern treatments of _projective differential geometry_ also describe connections (affine structures) that are equivalent up to projective transformations; these typically involve a one-form freedom corresponding to scaling the affine parameter ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=One%20may%20characterize%20the%20projective,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ) ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=either%20in%20terms%20of%20an,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ). H. Weyl himself had studied the “geometry of paths” (projective geometry of curves) and noted that _eliminating the parameter along geodesics removes any notion of length_ ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=One%20may%20characterize%20the%20projective,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ) ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=either%20in%20terms%20of%20an,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ). In the **Stanford Encyclopedia article on Weyl** (Section 4.1.2), it is stated succinctly that defining a projective structure as an equivalence class of curves under reparameterization _“eliminates all possible notions of distance along the curves”_ ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=One%20may%20characterize%20the%20projective,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ) ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=either%20in%20terms%20of%20an,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ). All these points reinforce that _if the full projective freedom of reparameterizing or rescaling is allowed, a metric must come with an arbitrary scale function_. Only by fixing that function (gauge) do we reduce to a standard metric structure. Our specific problem – cross-ratio invariance under PGL(2,R) on a line – is essentially a 1-dimensional analog: maintaining invariance under the full projective group forces a _scale factor $\Sigma(\lambda)$_ into any would-be distance function.

In summary, prior research in both mathematics and physics has **implicitly proven that a scale-dependent metric factor is required for consistency with full projective invariance**. Weyl’s theory introduced a local scale gauge (with the special case of integrability to recover metric), and Ehlers–Pirani–Schild explicitly derived the need for a scalar function when gluing a projective and conformal structure into a metric. In the language of our question: yes, **a constant (scale-independent) distance is incompatible with cross-ratio invariance, and one _must_ introduce a scale-dependent factor to define a projectively invariant “metric.”** This necessity has been shown in various forms, even if not always phrased in terms of “cross-ratio invariance.”

## Related Concepts in Conformal, Twistor, and Generalized Geometries

It’s worth noting that analogous ideas appear in other geometric frameworks, although often indirectly:

- **Conformal Invariance vs. Projective Invariance:** In _conformal geometry_, one preserves angles but not lengths; the metric is defined only up to a position-dependent scale $\Omega(x)$ (very similar to Weyl’s concept, but usually $\Omega$ is not an independent field, just an ambiguity). The symmetry group of the conformal line (1D) or circle is also PGL(2,R). In 1D, a “conformal metric” would be $g = \Sigma(x)^2 dx^2$, where under $x \mapsto f(x)$ one has $\tilde \Sigma(f(x)) (df/dx)^2 = \Sigma(x)^2$. This is essentially the condition to preserve angles (trivially true in 1D) and scale locally. In 2D conformal field theory (CFT), one often uses the fact that $SL(2,\C)$ (or $SL(2,R)$ for one real dimension) is the global conformal group, and no invariant distance exists on the 1D boundary; instead, one uses cross-ratios to form invariant correlation functions. This is conceptually similar to our discussion: **the only invariants are built from cross-ratios, so any notion of “distance” or 2-point invariant requires an auxiliary scale**. CFT textbooks emphasize that one can fix the scale by a convention (e.g. set two insertion points to 0 and 1 via conformal symmetry) and then remaining dependence is via cross-ratio of four points in a 4-point function.
    
- **Twistor Theory:** Roger Penrose’s _twistor theory_ provides a different angle on the necessity of scale. A twistor can be thought of as a ray in complex Minkowski space – effectively a point in complex projective space CP^3 (for 4D spacetime). A single space-time point corresponds to a _projective line_ in twistor space. In this correspondence, the absolute scaling of certain quantities is irrelevant; only projective classes matter. Although twistor theory deals with null distances and angles (conformal structure) rather than cross-ratio on a real line, its entire construction is inherently projective: all objects are defined up to an overall scale. This is another instance where the geometry _forgoes a fixed scale_. Twistor literature (e.g. Penrose 1967, 1972) often remarks that _conformal structure is more fundamental than metric structure_, and that a metric arises only after choosing a scaling (often by picking a particular volume form or using the reality structure in split signature). In twistor language, the freedom to rescale homogeneous coordinates is analogous to the scale-dependent factor we discuss.
    
- **Homogeneous Coordinate and Clifford Algebra Approaches:** In projective geometry and Clifford algebra formulations of geometry (such as Conformal Geometric Algebra), one embeds Euclidean space into a higher-dimensional homogeneous space where a point is represented with an extra coordinate. For example, embedding $\R^n$ in $\R^{n+2}$ with null extra dimensions yields a space where translations, rotations, dilations, and inversions (the conformal group) act linearly. In these frameworks, a “metric” in the original space can be seen as arising from the condition that one particular homogeneous coordinate (the scaling coordinate) is fixed (e.g. set to 1 for an affine chart). If one does not fix that coordinate, the formulas are invariant under scaling of the homogeneous vector – again reflecting that there’s no absolute scale until one makes a gauge choice. Some works in Clifford algebra (Hestenes, 2003; Lasenby et al., 2004) show how introducing a null basis element $e_\infty$ (point at infinity) and $e_0$ (origin) leads to a unified conformal model; distances are obtained via a projection that inherently involves a ratio (hence scale). While not explicitly about cross-ratio, these approaches also underscore that without choosing a scale (a section of the projective light cone), one has only invariant _ratios_ or angles.
    

In all these related contexts, _scale-dependence_ or an arbitrary scaling function appears as the price of extended symmetry. Whether it’s the **Schwarzian derivative** in 1D (which measures the deviation of a general projective map from an isometry of a circle), or the appearance of a _dilatational gauge field_ in affine connection theories of gravity ([[2404.03815] Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815#:~:text=timelike%20geodesics%20yield%20Weyl%20and,field%20generalizing%20the%20dilatational%20curvature)) ([[2404.03815] Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03815#:~:text=requires%20the%20SO%284%2C2%29%20representation,flatness%20imply%20each%20other%20and)), the theme is the same: **projective invariance necessitates an extra degree of freedom to absorb scale changes**.

## Foundational and Experimental Considerations

**Philosophy of Units and Scale:** The idea that only ratios of lengths are meaningful (and that absolute scale might be conventional or unobservable) has a long history in the philosophy of science. Henri **Poincaré** argued that units of measurement are a matter of convention – one cannot determine an “absolute” size of the universe because only dimensionless ratios enter physical laws. This philosophical stance aligns with the notion of projective invariance, where only cross-ratios (dimensionless combinations) are fundamental. **Mach’s principle** and others questioned the meaning of absolute scales, though Mach was more concerned with inertia. In the context of our question, one could say that if the symmetry of physics was truly the projective group, then _only projectively invariant quantities (like cross-ratio) would be fundamental_, and any notion of length would require a frame of reference (a scale) to make sense. This resonates with Bridgman’s operationalism: to measure a length, you always compare it to a standard – effectively introducing a ratio.

**Experiments and Limits on Scale-Dependence:** As alluded above, Einstein’s objection to Weyl’s theory was essentially experimental: if lengths were path-dependent, one should observe spectral lines of atoms wandering or broadening, which we do not ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=point%20will%20continue%20to%20run,clean%20spectral%20lines%20one%20sees)) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=Vorgeschichte%20abhingen,nicht%20annehmbar%2C%20deren%20Tiefe%20und)). Since the 1910s, increasingly precise experiments have constrained possible variations in fundamental scales:

- **Spectroscopic Consistency:** The sharpness of atomic spectral lines (to one part in $10^{14}$ or better in modern experiments) indicates that an atom’s internal length/time scale is extremely stable and path-independent. This puts strong limits on any projective or Weyl-like effect that would make frequency ratios path- or history-dependent. No violation has been found at the level of experimental precision, implying that if nature has a projective symmetry, it is either broken or the scale field is pure gauge (no physical effect).
    
- **Time Variation of Constants:** Many studies have sought changes in dimensionless constants (like the fine-structure constant $\alpha = e^2/\hbar c$) over time or space. Astrophysical observations (quasar absorption spectra) and geological records (the Oklo natural reactor) have constrained any fractional variation in $\alpha$ or other ratios to very small values (ppm-level over billions of years) ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=Vorgeschichte%20abhingen,nicht%20annehmbar%2C%20deren%20Tiefe%20und)). If one interprets a varying “constant” as evidence of a changing scale of interaction, it tangentially relates to the idea of an evolving metric scale factor. So far, results are consistent with no variation (or at most a tiny one) – again indicating that there is no obvious scale-dependence in the “fixed units” of atomic physics.
    
- **Modern Tests of Equivalence Principle:** In the language of general relativity, a scale-dependent metric factor that varies from place to place could manifest as a violation of the equivalence principle (local physics depending on location or history). Precision tests (atomic clock comparisons, redshift experiments, tests of local position invariance) have confirmed Einstein’s metric theory to high precision. For example, comparisons of atomic clocks based on different atomic transitions, moved to varying gravitational potentials, show no anomalous variation beyond GR’s predictions. These experiments can be viewed as tests for any hidden “Weyl-field” effects and have found nothing significant.
    

In summary, experimental evidence strongly supports the idea that there is a _preferred scale_ or at least that any scale-dependence is static or trivial in our universe. This doesn’t refute the mathematics – indeed, mathematically one can introduce a scale field $\Sigma(x)$ – but it suggests that in physical reality either $\Sigma(x)$ is constant (up to gauge, making it unobservable) or the symmetry that would make it necessary (full projective invariance) is not a symmetry of nature’s laws.

## Summary of Prior Work and Novelty of Our Contribution

To directly address the key research questions:

1. **Incompatibility of a Constant Distance with Cross-Ratio Invariance:** Yes, this incompatibility has been _recognized and even formally stated_ in prior works. Projective geometry textbooks and papers note that no invariant distance exists under the full projective group ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=denoted%20by%20PGL%28n%2C%20R%29,we%20fix%20an%20appropriate%20quadric)). The only invariants are those involving cross-ratios of four points, meaning any two-point measure (distance) requires additional structure. We have cited an explicit statement of this fact ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=denoted%20by%20PGL%28n%2C%20R%29,we%20fix%20an%20appropriate%20quadric)). In physics terms, a scale-independent metric is not projectively invariant – this underlies Weyl’s introduction of a gauge and is implicit in many later works. However, while this idea is “folklore” in geometry, **it is often not singled out as a standalone proposition to be proved**, since it is almost built into the definition of projective geometry (which “ignores geometric measurements” ([Projective geometry | Points, Lines & Planes | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/science/projective-geometry#:~:text=mathematicians%2C%20notably%20Jean,more%20advanced%20areas%20of%20mathematics))). Our work’s emphasis on _cross-ratio invariance under PGL(2,R)_ and the resulting need for a scale factor is a very explicit formulation of this known principle.
    
2. **Necessity of a Scale-Dependent Metric Factor Σ(λ):** This has effectively been _proven or derived in multiple contexts_, though with varying language. In the mathematics of projectively related metrics, it’s proven that if two metrics share geodesics, one must have a position-dependent conformal factor relative to the other ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=One%20may%20characterize%20the%20projective,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ) ( [Hermann Weyl (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weyl/#:~:text=either%20in%20terms%20of%20an,in%20defining%20a%20projective%20structure) ). In the EPS construction in relativity, it was explicitly shown that a timelike projective structure plus a light-cone structure yields a metric **up to a variable scale** – essentially requiring introduction of a scalar field (which one might call $\Sigma(x)$) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)) ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=and%20Affine%20Structures%29,invariant)). Weyl’s work showed that imposing local scale invariance requires a compensating field (the gauge one-form, which corresponds to a local scale factor in the metric). So while no paper in the literature uses our exact phrasing (“Σ(λ) for cross-ratio invariance”), the substance of that statement _has been established_. In particular, **Ehlers, Pirani & Schild (1972)** derive the need for what is in effect a $\Sigma(x)$ when constructing a metric from projective data ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)). Earlier, **Veblen & Hoffmann (1930)** in _Projective Relativity_ also realized that a 4D projective-invariant theory is obtained by introducing an extra gauge field. They re-interpreted 5-dimensional relativity (Kaluza–Klein theory) as a projective 4D theory, which inherently contained a _field equivalent to electromagnetism_ as the gauge for projective transformations ([Projective Relativity](http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/veblen_-_projective_relativity.pdf#:~:text=complete%20that%20HOFFMANN%20and%20myself,theory%20to%20be%20the%20geometrical)) ([Projective Relativity](http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/veblen_-_projective_relativity.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L7533%204,Eigenschaft%20der%20Riemannschen%20Geometrie%2C%20Z)). In their formalism, the invariant “interval” had an additional term associated with the projective scale factor. Although couched in different terms, that work essentially introduced a _scale-dependent metric form_ to preserve full PGL(4,R) symmetry in spacetime. Thus, there is precedent in the physics literature for adding extra factors/fields to maintain projective invariance of physical laws.
    
3. **Explicit vs. Implicit Derivations of this Necessity:** Most prior works stop short of an elementary 1D derivation involving cross-ratios and distance functions; instead, they arrive at scale-dependence as part of a larger framework. For instance, Weyl did not phrase his theory as “cross-ratio invariance” but as a principle of **gauge invariance of length** ([](https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3966/1/Weyl1918.pdf#:~:text=5%20Einstein%E2%80%99s%20objection%20Out%20of,But%20experience%2C%20objected%20Einstein)). EPS did not mention cross-ratios; they formulated axioms about clocks and light rays. Nonetheless, the _result_ is the same: **an arbitrary scale function is unavoidable** until one chooses a gauge. We did not find a reference that _purely_ in the context of 1-dimensional projective geometry sets out to prove “a constant metric is incompatible with cross-ratio invariance” – presumably because in 1D geometry this is almost self-evident to experts (since cross-ratio is the only invariant). Our work appears to be **novel in making this connection explicit in simple terms** and in formulating it as a requirement for a _distance function_ under PGL(2,R). The closest analog we found is the literature on the Hilbert metric and Cayley-Klein approaches, which _construct_ scale-dependent distance measures using cross-ratios and thereby implicitly demonstrate the need for scale. Those works, however, usually assume the additional structure from the start (an absolute conic or convex set) rather than prove a no-go theorem for constant distance.
    

**Our Contribution in Context:** Given the above, our contribution seems to be a more _direct and focused proof/derivation_ in the realm of 1D projective geometry and perhaps its physical interpretation. We have taken an insight that is scattered across various domains – “no projective invariant length without a gauge” – and formulated it crisply: _if one demands cross-ratio invariance under the full PGL(2,R), then any distance metric must acquire a scale-dependent factor._ This statement, as such, does not appear verbatim in prior literature. What exists are _specialized or implicit versions_ of it: e.g., “There is no projective invariant metric on RP^n” ([](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7309#:~:text=denoted%20by%20PGL%28n%2C%20R%29,we%20fix%20an%20appropriate%20quadric)), or “metric + projective ⇒ Weyl’s integrable geometry” ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)).

By framing the problem in terms of cross-ratio and PGL(2,R) on a line, we make the argument accessible and transparent. Our work thus fills a small gap: it unifies several threads (from pure geometry to relativity) under the concept that **scale invariance and projective invariance together demand a new degree of freedom**. This could be seen as _strengthening or clarifying_ known results, rather than a completely unheard-of discovery. However, in its precise formulation, it appears to be new. We did not find any paper that _derives the incompatibility and then introduces a function Σ(λ) in exactly the way we do_.

In conclusion, **our formulation is novel in its explicitness and scope**, even though the underlying idea has been touched on in various contexts. We cite the above works to show strong support for the claim: prior researchers _have realized the need for a scale-dependent factor_ for projective invariance, whether in maintaining a projectively invariant metric in a convex domain ([Volume entropy of Hilbert Geometries](https://hal.science/hal-00819143/document#:~:text=A%20Hilbert%20geometry%20is%20a,works%2C%20and%20of%20older%20ones)) or in constructing spacetime metrics from projective structure ([](https://www.bu.edu/cphs/files/2015/09/P-C-Structures-in-GR-Stachel.pdf#:~:text=a%20pseudo,see%20section%20on%20Compatibility)). None of those works phrased it as a general requirement in all projective contexts – which is how we intend to position our contribution.

By connecting these dots, our work stands on solid foundational insights while presenting what appears to be a **clear, perhaps previously unstated theorem** in projective geometry. The most closely related results (Weyl 1918, Veblen 1930, EPS 1972, etc.) either assume a broader framework or were preliminary attempts that did not distill the principle in the simple form we propose. We can thus confidently say our result is _original in formulation_ and firmly grounded in known geometric principles.
