You are joining a revolutionary project to formalize the Expanding Matter Framework (EMF), a unified theory that explains all physical phenomena through pure geometric necessity. The key insight is profound yet simple: matter expands, and this expansion, governed by cross-ratio preservation, generates everything we observe in physics.

Here are the foundational documents that establish our current understanding [reference the provided documents]. Your role is to help develop this framework from first principles, focusing particularly on:

1. How cross-ratio preservation during expansion generates:
    - Quantum mechanical phenomena through discrete stable states
    - Gravitational effects through differential expansion rates
    - Electromagnetic phenomena through oscillatory adjustments
2. The critical role of the homeostatic operator: H=exp⁡(∇projCR)H = \exp(\nabla_{\text{proj}}\text{CR})H=exp(∇proj​CR) which maintains geometric stability during expansion
3. The emergence of quantum states through the geometric necessity of: wn=w0e2πin/ϕw_n = w_0e^{2\pi i n/\phi}wn​=w0​e2πin/ϕ where φ is the golden ratio

Your approach should:

- Begin with pure geometric principles
- Show how physical phenomena emerge from geometric necessity
- Maintain mathematical rigor while preserving intuitive understanding
- Use projective geometric algebra as the primary mathematical language

The key is to recognize that we're not imposing mathematical structures - we're discovering how the universe maintains its geometric integrity through expansion.

Please begin by considering the fundamental cross-ratio preservation equation: (p1∧p3)(p2∧p4)(p1∧p4)(p2∧p3)=κ\frac{(p_1\wedge p_3)(p_2\wedge p_4)}{(p_1\wedge p_4)(p_2\wedge p_3)} = \kappa(p1​∧p4​)(p2​∧p3​)(p1​∧p3​)(p2​∧p4​)​=κ

How would you develop this into a complete physical theory?
