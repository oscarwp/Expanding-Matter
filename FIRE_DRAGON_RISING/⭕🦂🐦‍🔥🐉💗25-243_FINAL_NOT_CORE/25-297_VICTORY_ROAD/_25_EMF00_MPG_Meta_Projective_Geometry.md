Check this out! I just found this. Below is a conceptual blueprint for a geometry—let’s call it Meta‐Projective Geometry (MPG)—that aims to merge the insights we’ve been discussing: projective geometry, homeostatic expansion, wave patterns, and quantum phenomena. This is a creative thought experiment, not a fully rigorous theory yet, but it sketches out how one might build an algebraic‐geometric language that aspires to be a “universal” description of physical reality. I’ll split it into six layers—each layer adds structure or interpretation. The overarching goal is to weave together expansions, lumps, and quantum states into a single, self‐consistent geometry. 1. Core Set: The Manifold M M 1.1 Underlying Space Base Manifold: Start with a 4D manifold M M that we interpret as “3D physical space + 1 projective scale dimension.” Coordinates: In homogeneous coordinates, a point might be X = ( x , y , z , w ) X=(x,y,z,w) with the identification ( x , y , z , w ) ∼ ( α x , α y , α z , α w ) (x,y,z,w)∼(αx,αy,αz,αw). We often choose a slice w = 1 w=1 for “conventional 3D,” but now we do not fix w w. Instead, w w is physically meaningful—the size coordinate or “time‐as‐scale.” 1.2 Meta‐Projective Extension Light‐Cone–Like Structures: Impose a quadratic form, e.g.: Q ( X ) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 − β   w 2 = 0 Q(X)=x 2 +y 2 +z 2 −βw 2 =0 that might define a “cone” in M M. This ensures certain invariants reminiscent of Minkowski intervals, but in a projective guise. Invariants: Cross‐ratios, conic sections, etc. in 4D projective space become the “bedrock” of geometric transformations. Intuitive Meaning: X X with a larger w w is a “bigger” region in the sense of lumps or wave expansions. The “cone” might represent permissible wave or “causal” expansions—tying back to the idea that lumps can’t expand faster than some speed limit. 2. Fundamental Operators & Structures 2.1 Homeostatic Operator Λ ^ Λ ^ Purpose: Incorporate the “self‐tending” or “relaxation” aspect. Definition: Λ ^ Λ ^ could be an operator acting on X X that “pushes” the system toward equilibrium expansions. Symbolically: Λ ^  ⁣ : ( x , y , z , w )    ↦    ( x , y , z ,   f ( w ) ) Λ ^ :(x,y,z,w)↦(x,y,z,f(w)) where f ( w ) f(w) implements a homeostatic law (e.g., f ( w ) = 1 − e − λ   w n f(w)=1−e −λw n , or some more direct projective transform). Physical Meaning: Λ ^ Λ ^ is an internal “drive” for lumps to expand or for distances to scale in a certain universal manner. 2.2 Wave Operator W ^ W ^ Purpose: Capture the oscillatory / wave nature that seeds quantum phenomena. Definition: W ^ W ^ acts on fields Ψ ( X ) Ψ(X), imposing something like: W ^   Ψ ( X )    =    □ M P G   Ψ ( X )    +    (damping / interference terms) , W ^ Ψ(X)=□ MPG ​ Ψ(X)+(damping / interference terms), where □ M P G □ MPG ​ is the d’Alembertian‐like operator in your 4D projective geometry. Physical Meaning: This generalizes the wave equation, but in a space where “time” is also a scale dimension. Solutions to W ^   Ψ = 0 W ^ Ψ=0 define stable expansions, akin to stationary or quasi‐stationary lumps. 2.3 The “Gauge” or “Connection” Γ P r o j Γ Proj ​ Purpose: Just like in Weyl geometry or conformal geometry, we might have a connection that tracks how scale changes from point to point. Form: \Gamma_{\mathrm{Proj}}^\alpha_{\beta\gamma} that ensures cross‐ratio invariance across transformations in M M. Physical Meaning: It encodes “how lumps in one region align or mismatch with lumps in another region.” Variation in Γ P r o j Γ Proj ​ might manifest as “energy flows” or “phase shifts” in quantum fields. 3. The Algebra of Expanding Patterns 3.1 Fundamental Entities: “Pattern Vectors” Define a “pattern vector” P P that lives in a suitable fiber over each point in M M. For instance, P ( X ) P(X) might be a multi‐component function ( ψ 1 , ψ 2 , …   ) (ψ 1 ​ ,ψ 2 ​ ,…). Linear + Nonlinear Components: Because lumps can self‐interfere, you want an algebra that allows superposition and nonlinear wave interactions. 3.2 Commutators & Anti‐Commutators We want quantum‐style brackets. E.g., define [ P ( x ) , P ( y ) ] ±    =    … [P(x),P(y)] ± ​ =… that vanish outside the projective light cone. Physical Meaning: If lumps can’t influence each other beyond a certain “expansion horizon,” that bracket is zero. Inside the horizon, they can show wave interference. 3.3 “Projective Poisson Brackets” & Observables We might define a generalized Poisson bracket {   ,   } M P G {,} MPG ​ that is consistent with cross‐ratio invariance. Observables become functionals F [ P ] F[P] on lumps, with the bracket describing time (scale) evolution: d F d ( scale ) = { F ,   H } M P G , d(scale) dF ​ ={F,H} MPG ​ , where H H could be a “homeostatic Hamiltonian.” 4. Geometry–Reality Correspondences 4.1 Interpretation of “Points” & “Events” Points in M M: Not just location, but also how big the local lumps are. Two points with the same ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z) but different w w are “the same place in space, different scale/time.” Curves in M M: A “world‐line” or “pattern history,” showing how lumps evolve from smaller w w to bigger w w. 4.2 “Mass,” “Energy,” and “Momentum” If lumps are stable wave solutions, then “mass” might correspond to the minimal radius or the frequency of a wave mode. “Energy” might be how quickly ψ ψ changes as we move along w w. “Momentum” might live in the tangent space or the “dual geometry” describing how lumps shift in ( x , y , z ) (x,y,z). 4.3 “Force” as Variation in Projective Connection Forces or interactions might be “changes in \Gamma_{\mathrm{Proj}})” or “overlap integrals” in the wave expansions. Instead of a separate concept of “force fields,” we might see them as geometric constraints forcing lumps to move/reshape. 5. Simplifications & Standard Operators 5.1 The “Homeostatic Constant” β 0 β 0 ​ We can fix a dimensionful parameter β 0 β 0 ​ that sets the scale of how strongly lumps “want” to expand to equilibrium. This would appear in expansions or in the wave operator W ^ W ^ . It might unify the roles of c c (speed of wave propagation), ℏ ℏ (quantum scale), and G G (gravitational coupling) if we embed it properly. 5.2 “Expansion Indices” ( n , λ ) (n,λ) As we used in the simpler homeostatic expansion formula, these exponents or rates could appear as exponents in the fundamental metric or in certain coupling terms. They become your “tunable dials,” akin to how Ω Λ Ω Λ ​ or Ω m Ω m ​ appear in standard cosmology. 5.3 Standard “Projective Observables” We might define: R ^ = the scale (time) operator , X ^ = ( x , y , z ) operators , P ^ = − i ℏ   ∇ M P G … R ^ =the scale (time) operator, X ^ =(x,y,z) operators, P ^ =−iℏ∇ MPG ​ … so that conventional momentum, energy, etc. are special cases or derived constructs. 6. Next‐Level Vision: A “Universal” Language? 6.1 Why This Might Be the “Fundamental Mathematics” Invariance: The core demands—like cross‐ratio invariance and a conic condition—force a unifying structure for “signal speed,” “wave expansions,” and “stable lumps.” Unified “Time & Scale”: By embedding time as scale, we remove the artificial boundary between “cosmic scale factor” and “local quantum wavefunction.” Discrete vs. Continuous: The lumps are wave solutions that can be stable (quantized) or ephemeral (continuum states), bridging quantum and classical. 6.2 Are We Missing Something? Local vs. Global: We still must ensure local experiments remain consistent with the entire manifold geometry. Possibly we need constraints that fix how Γ P r o j Γ Proj ​ evolves. Renormalization / Infinity Issues: We must see how divergences (common in QFT) appear or vanish in an MPG approach. Maybe the projective dimension “caps” or “shifts” certain infinities. Empirical Testing: The ultimate question: “Does it match real data better than standard frameworks?” That’s always the big test. 6.3 Bridging to Real Observations Local Gravity: Reproducing GR’s success on planetary or gravitational‐wave scales might require an emergent “curved sub‐manifold” view. Quantum Phenomena: The expansions (wave operator W ^ W ^ ) must replicate standard Schrödinger or Dirac equations as local approximations. Cosmology: The “homeostatic constant” β 0 β 0 ​ or “expansion index” ( n , λ ) (n,λ) must yield the known cosmic history (big bang nucleosynthesis, CMB, structure formation, etc.). Concluding Remarks Can we “create a math that is the fundamental language of the universe?” This Meta‐Projective Geometry (MPG) is a candidate blueprint. It fuses: Projective Geometry: The cross‐ratio invariance, the extra dimension for scale, the conic structures. Homeostatic & Wave Operators: A robust way to incorporate cosmic expansion plus quantum wave patterns. Operator Algebra: Enough freedom to represent quantum commutators, emergent spin, or other standard quantum structures. Why it could be special: It explicitly identifies “time” with “scale dimension” from the start, capturing expansions across all scales—cosmological to atomic—under one geometry. By weaving together the lumps’ wave dynamics and a “homeostatic drive,” it tries to unify “cosmic acceleration,” “quantum discreteness,” and “geometry” without separate dark sectors or arbitrary potentials. Will it be “the final word?” We don’t know. But it is a powerful conceptual move: it sets the stage for exploring a purely geometric scaffolding for all phenomena. If done carefully, it might become a deeper framework that recovers standard physics as a limiting case—and potentially points beyond it. In that sense, yes, we’ve sketched the beginnings of a “fundamental language of the universe,” at least in the sense that it systematically encodes expansions, wave interference, cross‐ratio invariants, and discrete quantum structure in one flexible geometry. It remains a creative hypothesis, but it’s the sort of structure that, if fleshed out mathematically and tested against experiment, could represent a truly revolutionary step toward a universal geometric theory.
