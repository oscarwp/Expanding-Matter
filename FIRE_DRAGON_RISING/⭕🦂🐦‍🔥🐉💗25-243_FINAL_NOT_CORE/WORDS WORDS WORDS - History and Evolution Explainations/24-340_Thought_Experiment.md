The Thought Experiment

1. The Universe Model: Expanding Circles  
    Starting Point: A 2D universe is composed of tightly packed, uniform circles arranged in a larger circular structure. These circles:  
    Are uniform in size.  
    Cannot overlap.  
    Expand uniformly outward from their centers, maintaining shape and adjacency.
2. The Observer's Experience and Need for Explanation  
    Local Observations: An observer within this universe perceives their immediate surroundings as static since all circles, including their own, expand uniformly.  
    Distant Observations: When observing distant regions, the expansion becomes apparent, creating contradictions between local and distant observations.  
    Need for Explanations:  
    The observer develops theories to reconcile these observations, such as inventing concepts like "dark energy" to explain the apparent outward movement of distant circles.  
    These theories emerge from a fundamental misunderstanding: the observer does not realize that their own circle is expanding, influencing their perception of the universe.
3. Emergent Geometry and Theoretical Complexity  
    Distortion of the Universe: As the circles expand, the overall shape of the universe distorts, which the observer interprets as an evolving cosmic structure.  
    Complicating Theories:  
    To account for the observed expansion and distortions, the observer may hypothesize invisible forces or fields, adding layers of complexity to their explanations.  
    These theories, while internally consistent, are increasingly convoluted as they attempt to reconcile local stability with distant expansion.
4. Introducing Dense Regions (Planets)  
    Higher-Density Circles: Some regions consist of more densely packed circles (planets), which also expand equally.  
    Gravity Analogy:  
    Observers near these dense regions notice an apparent attraction to them, leading to the development of a gravitational theory.  
    However, this “gravity” is an emergent effect of the density-driven imbalance in expansion forces, not a fundamental force.
5. Propagation of Vibrations (Light)  
    Light Waves: Vibrations travel through the circles to represent light. When passing near dense regions, these vibrations bend, mimicking gravitational lensing.  
    Theories of Light:  
    Observers attribute this bending to a gravitational field, further complicating their understanding of their universe’s fundamental mechanics.
6. Scaling the Model to Atoms  
    Expanding Atoms: Extending the model to our universe, atoms replace circles, with properties such as:  
    Expansion proportional to atomic weight.  
    Creation of gravitational-like effects from denser atomic arrangements.  
    Complex Theoretical Layers:  
    The observer, unaware of atomic expansion, builds concepts like spacetime and quantum fields to describe interactions, layering these explanations on misunderstood phenomena.
7. Overlapping Nature of Atoms  
    Infinite Overlap:  
    Atoms extend indefinitely and overlap, resolving issues such as electron probability and the apparent continuity of matter.  
    Observers misinterpret this overlap as probabilistic behavior, leading to quantum mechanics' counterintuitive explanations.  
    No Vacuum:  
    The concept of empty space (vacuum) is an illusion; the universe is entirely composed of expanding, overlapping matter.
8. The Observer's Theoretical Spiral  
    Increasing Complexity:  
    Observers develop increasingly intricate models, such as quantum uncertainty and spacetime curvature, to reconcile observations at different scales.  
    These models are rooted in the failure to recognize the universe’s fundamental property: expansion.  
    Cumulative Confusion:  
    Each new observation (e.g., redshift, gravitational lensing, quantum entanglement) leads to further elaborations, creating a tangled web of theories that move farther from the simple truth of the universe's mechanics.
9. Unified Theory: Expanding Matter  
    Key Assertions:  
    The universe is composed entirely of expanding matter.  
    Fields and forces are not fundamental but emergent from the interactions of expanding, overlapping matter.  
    Phenomena such as gravity, redshift, and quantum uncertainty are natural consequences of this expansion.
10. Observational Limitations and Insights  
    Local vs. Global Observations:  
    Observers’ theories become more accurate when considering distant phenomena (e.g., redshift) because the expansion’s effects dominate.  
    Locally, their theories fail because they cannot account for their own expansion and its impact on measurements.  
    Matter-Time: Time is redefined as a relative measure of the size and location of expanding matter, explaining its apparent flow and irreversibility.
