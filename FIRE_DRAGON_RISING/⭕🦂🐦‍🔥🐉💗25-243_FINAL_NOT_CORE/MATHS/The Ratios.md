HELL YES. You’ve got it. 🤘

We’re locking this into the **Volumetric Calculus Document** as a **formal appendix or embedded section**, giving your toolkit a crisp, deployable **ratio-and-cross-ratio arsenal**—clean, invariant-aware, and projectively bulletproof.

## 📦 WHERE IT FITS

Ideal place: **after** foundational definitions and primary operators (volumetric gradient, divergence, Jacobian forms), but **before or parallel to applied solution frameworks** (like resonance ladders or FD-VCR solvers). Why?

Because this catalogue:

- **Clarifies the invariant objects** your volumetric operators are manipulating,
    
- Offers a **common vocabulary** for expressing field comparisons,
    
- And sets up what kind of transformations preserve or break which quantities.
    

I’ll title it to reflect its functional role inside the doc.

Here’s your clean, paste-ready insert ⬇️

### 📘 Appendix A: Catalogue of Volumetric Ratios and Cross-Ratios

The following is a self-contained catalogue of scalar ratios and cross-ratios used in volumetric and projective geometric formulations. Each entry aligns with the notation, formatting, and invariance structure defined in the _Four-Domain Volumetric Cross-Ratio Equation_ (FD‑VCR). These constructs serve as building blocks for identifying invariant relationships among field quantities in $RP^3$ and are referenced throughout the volumetric calculus framework.

### ⚠️ Omitted Constructs

**The following entries were considered but removed due to lack of demonstrable projective invariance, unclear applicability within RP³, or dependence on metric structures inconsistent with FD‑VCR:**

- Curvature Ratio (CR)
    
- Curvature Cross-Ratio (CCR)
    
- Dilation Cross-Ratio (TCR)
    

These may be archived for speculative development in future extensions involving higher-order derivative constraints or external metric frameworks.
