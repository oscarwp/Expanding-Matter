# n ≈ 70 — Dodecahedron

## Summary

**Geometry:** Dodecahedral configuration formed from approximately 70 balls
**Dimension:** 3D
**VCR (asserted in system):** 7/3
**Status:** Consistently cited as one of the four generative configurations
**Why here:** This is the final and largest configuration in the generative set (n = 5, 12, ≈29, ≈70). It exhibits dodecahedral symmetry and is linked to gravitational resonance.
**Open proof:** VCR = 7/3 has not been derived from geometry.

## Candidates

* **Dodecahedron (\~70 balls):** Treated as a volumetric, high-symmetry structure. Referred to as the configuration associated with gravitational emergence. Regarded as the fourth generative shape.

---

## Derivation (Planned)

Goal: Derive VCR = 7/3 by assigning Ψ₁–Ψ₆ within the dodecahedral contact structure or along large-scale symmetry axes. Geometry may involve recursive nesting or volumetric harmonics.

## Decisions

* ✅ Accepted: Dodecahedral configuration at n ≈ 70
* 🟡 Open: Derivation of VCR = 7/3

## Working Notes

**Next Actions:**

* Attempt physical modeling or lattice construction of the 70-ball structure
* Analyze how symmetry segments map to VCR components
* Examine its relationship to n = 90 and its role in gravitational resonance layering
