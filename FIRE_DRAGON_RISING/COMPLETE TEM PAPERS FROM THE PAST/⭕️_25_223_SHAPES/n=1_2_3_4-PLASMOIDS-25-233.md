# n = 1–4 — Plasmoid Configurations

---

## Summary

**Geometry:** 2D or pre-volumetric ball arrangements
**Dimension:** Primarily 2D (planar), non-spherical
**Status:** Observed and referenced in system texts as plasmoid-type configurations
**Why here:** These early stable or semi-stable configurations represent the boundary between non-manifestation and recursion. They are critical to the system’s recursive base and are often referenced as plasma-like or field-seeding shapes.
**Open proof:** VCR values are not consistently defined or derived at these low n-values. Their inclusion is empirical and theoretical--I think speculative is the right word here, at least until I can find some evidancce or mathematical reason other than this feels like a mostly semantic argument...  I still don't love that I don't have a math way to make helium this shape... oh...  why do I think I don't have that?  I should look for that...

## Candidates

* **n = 1:** Single ball (seed unit); symmetry center
* **n = 2:** Linear pair; reactive; appears in composability models and surface interactions
* **n = 3:** Planar triangle; locally stable but not composable upward
* **n = 4:** Planar square; observable and stable under specific constraints, but does not tile upward

## Working Notes

**Current Understanding:**

* Only n = 1 and n = 2 are fully composable in system logic
* n = 3 and n = 4 are observed but likely fail the composability constraint and are not part of the recursive chain
* These shapes are necessary for complete construction logic and likely function as seeds, coupling layers, or transition configurations

## References

* Identified in *Geometric Derivation* and *Volumetric Calculus* as plasmonic kernels
* n = 1 appears as base of all recursive configurations
* n = 2 cited in *Projective Completeness Theorem* as a boundary interaction element
* n = 3 and 4 appear in magnet-ball modeling and geometric enumeration, but not in final composability sequence
