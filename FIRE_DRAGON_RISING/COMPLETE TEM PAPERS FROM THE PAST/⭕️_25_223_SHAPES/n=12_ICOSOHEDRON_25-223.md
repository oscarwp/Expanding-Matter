# n = 12 — Icosahedron

## Summary

**Geometry:** Twelve-ball configuration with icosahedral symmetry
**Dimension:** 3D
**VCR (asserted in system):** 5/3
**Status:** Physically constructed and consistently cited in system documents
**Why here:** This is the first stable 3D configuration in the radix. Its ball centers match the vertex structure of a Euclidean icosahedron.
**Open proof:** The VCR = 5/3 lock has not yet been derived from geometry.

## Candidates

* **Icosahedral arrangement (12 balls):** Constructed with magnet balls. Closed structure with no center ball. Ball centers form a network that expresses icosahedral symmetry.

---

## Derivation (Planned)

Goal: derive VCR = 5/3 directly from the geometry of the 12-ball structure by assigning Ψ₁–Ψ₆ across meaningful contact paths or triangle chords. Construction must use edge relationships only—no center-based metrics.

## Decisions

* ✅ Accepted: 12-ball structure with icosahedral symmetry
* 🟡 Open: Derivation of VCR = 5/3

---

## Working Notes

**Next Actions:**

* Attempt cross-ratio derivation
* Test possible composition path from n = 5
* Examine relation to lepton behavior or field onset

**Fine-structure constant equation (from RM Appendix 1):**
The inverse of the fine-structure constant (α⁻¹) is approximated by:
α⁻¹ = (n₅ / n₁₂) × (φ / τ) × (F₈ / P₃)

Where:

* **α** is the fine-structure constant (≈ 1/137)
* `n₅ / n₁₂`: resonance scaling between two stable shape configurations
* `φ / τ`: ratio between the golden and silver means
* `F₈ / P₃`: Fibonacci and Pell numbers from recursive indexing
