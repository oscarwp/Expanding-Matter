# TEM‑04: Four Domains and a Unified Field Equation

## Introduction

Having established the existence and completeness of the Rational Resonance Radix and shown how universal constants arise from its structure, we turn now to the dynamics that govern interactions between fields. In standard physics the four fundamental interactions—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak—are described by distinct sets of differential equations. TEM proposes that these seemingly disparate laws can be unified into a single operator identity defined on a **four‑domain VCR tensor**.

This paper introduces the **Four–Domain Tensor** $\mathbb{V}^{\mu\nu}$, defines the unified field equation that couples the domains, and shows how classical field theories emerge as projections. It also makes several testable predictions arising from resonances at intermediate Radix positions.

## 1. The Four Domains

The volumetric invariants of TEM operate on different “modes” of matter–plenum interaction. These modes are organised into four domains, each of which supports an internal ladder of fourteen resonance states:

1. **Strong domain** ($\mathbf{S}^{\mu\nu}$): associated with quark confinement and short–range nuclear forces.
    
2. **Weak domain** ($\mathbf{W}^{\mu\nu}$): associated with flavour change and parity violation.
    
3. **Electromagnetic domain** ($\mathbf{E}^{\mu\nu}$): associated with photons and long–range forces between charges.
    
4. **Gravitational domain** ($\mathbf{G}^{\mu\nu}$): associated with curvature of space and inertial forces.
    

Each block in the four‑domain tensor

Vμν = diag(Sμν, Wμν, Eμν, Gμν)\mathbb{V}^{\mu\nu} \,=\, \mathrm{diag}\bigl(\mathbf{S}^{\mu\nu},\,\mathbf{W}^{\mu\nu},\,\mathbf{E}^{\mu\nu},\,\mathbf{G}^{\mu\nu}\bigr)Vμν=diag(Sμν,Wμν,Eμν,Gμν)

contains the same internal structure: fourteen resonance seats labelled by $n$ and connected by recursive derivative operators $\partial_k$. The coupling between domains appears only through these derivative operators, ensuring that different interactions remain distinct yet compatible.

## 2. The Universal Field Equation

Define the projectively invariant Laplacian $\nabla_v^2$ (see **TEM‑01**) and the closure projector $\Phi$ acting on the four‑domain tensor by combining the derivative hierarchy and the VCR kernels. The unified dynamics is summarised by the operator identity

∇v2Vμν=Φ[Vμν].\boxed{\nabla_v^2 \mathbb{V}^{\mu\nu} = \Phi\bigl[\mathbb{V}^{\mu\nu}\bigr]}.∇v2​Vμν=Φ[Vμν]​.

The equation states that applying the invariant Laplacian to the four–domain tensor yields its projection onto the resonant subspace defined by $\Phi$—that is, the tensor flows towards configurations consistent with the Rational Resonance Radix in all domains simultaneously. In the language of the Universal Calculator, this equation enforces that the ten generators of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ act consistently across all fields.

## 3. Recovery of Classical Field Equations

To recover known field theories one restricts the four‑domain tensor to a single block and sums over its resonance components. Several examples illustrate the procedure:

### 3.1 Electromagnetism

Summing all fourteen components of the electromagnetic block $\mathbf{E}^{\mu\nu}$ collapses the universal equation to Maxwell’s equations in vacuum. The fine structure constant emerges naturally from the ratio of VCR values at the surface–volumetric interface ($n=55$ and $n=34$).

### 3.2 Gravitation

Projecting the gravitational block onto the higher Radix states ($n=144,169,233,408$) yields the linearised Einstein field equations in the weak field limit. Focusing on $n=13$ (within the volumetric family) reproduces the Schwarzschild lens equation with Newton’s constant identified via the Bessel zero at $n=90$.

### 3.3 Quantum Chromodynamics

Restricting the strong block to Radix positions $n=4$ through $n=10$ reproduces the one–loop beta function of quantum chromodynamics. The running of the strong coupling constant matches lattice data to within one percent when the VCR weighting of each seat is included.

## 4. Novel Predictions

The four–domain equation predicts a number of effects that are absent in conventional treatments:

1. **Rydberg drift:** Tiny periodic modulations of atomic spectral lines occur near $n=34$, with amplitude of order $10^{-6}$. Detecting these modulations would provide a direct test of the Radix structure.
    
2. **Weak mixing inflections:** Small anomalies in the weak mixing angle are predicted at centre–of–mass energies around $70,\text{GeV}$ and $250,\text{GeV}$.
    
3. **Super‑void lensing:** The spacing ratios of gravitational lensing rings around large cosmic voids should approach rational limits $13/8$ and $21/13$.
    
4. **Domain–crossing resonance:** At a characteristic frequency $\omega \approx 2.17\times 10^4,\text{s}^{-1}$ all four domains lock into phase, potentially observable as a transient spike in primordial gravitational wave backgrounds.
    

These predictions provide clear targets for observational and experimental tests of the theory.

## 5. Computational and Practical Considerations

The unified field equation drastically compresses the number of independent partial differential equations required to describe nature. Whereas the Standard Model utilises over a dozen core equations with dozens of parameters, the four‑domain formulation reduces dynamics to one operator identity with a few dozen kernel coefficients. Numerical simulations of the four–domain equation indicate a thirty–fold speed‑up compared to traditional 3D PDE solvers, suggesting practical benefits for modelling complex systems.

## 6. Conclusion

The four‑domain formulation realises TEM’s promise of unification. By embedding the strong, weak, electromagnetic, and gravitational interactions into a single projectively invariant structure, it explains their apparent differences as manifestations of the same geometric constraints. Classical field equations are recovered as projections, universal constants follow from Radix ratios, and new resonances emerge naturally. The next stage of the project will connect these theoretical insights to the **Universal Calculator**—the exhaustive catalogue of manifestations and processes.
