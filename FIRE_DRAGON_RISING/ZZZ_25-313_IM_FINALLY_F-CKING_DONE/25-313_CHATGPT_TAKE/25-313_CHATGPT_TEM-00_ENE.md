# TEM‑00: The Existential Necessity of Expansion

## Introduction

The Theory of Expanding Matter (TEM) begins from a simple question: why does anything exist at all, and why does that existence take the form of an expanding universe? In standard cosmology expansion is treated as an empirical observation, a feature to be explained by a dynamical equation of state. TEM reverses the logic. It shows that if physical reality is assumed to be describable by **finite sets** of relations and embedded in **real projective three–space** ($\mathbb{RP}^3$), then _expansion_ is not an arbitrary dynamical outcome—it is the only coherent way for matter and structure to exist.

This paper sets out the axioms of the **Finitistic Physical Set Theory (FPST)** and explains how they lead to the existential necessity of expansion. It introduces the unique projective geometry underlying TEM and sets the stage for the construction of the volumetric invariants that drive the remainder of the theory.

## 1. Finitistic Physical Set Theory

Classical set theory includes the axiom of infinity, allowing the formation of sets of unbounded size. FPST omits this axiom and requires that every physically real set be finite. The central axioms are:

1. **Axiom of Finitude.** At any fixed instant the universe $U$ is a finite set. All subsets of $U$ are finite.
    
2. **Axiom of Realisability.** A subset $S \subseteq U$ exists if and only if it corresponds to a physically real configuration of things. No purely abstract collections exist.
    

Using these axioms we define the **cardinal number** $n$ as the equivalence class of all subsets of $U$ with $n$ elements. The collection of ratios of cardinal numbers yields the rational field $\mathbb{Q}$. In FPST the only valid numeric quantities are those which can be built from finite counts of real things.

## 2. The Ambient Geometry: $\mathbb{RP}^3$

TEM models physical space as **real projective three–space**. This space is obtained by taking lines through the origin of $\mathbb{R}^4$ and identifying points that differ by a non‑zero scalar multiple:

RP3  =  (R4∖{0})/∼,x∼y  ⟺  x=λy,  λ∈R∖{0}.\mathbb{RP}^3 \;=\; (\mathbb{R}^4 \setminus \{0\})\big/\sim,\quad x \sim y \iff x=\lambda y,\; \lambda\in\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}.RP3=(R4∖{0})/∼,x∼y⟺x=λy,λ∈R∖{0}.

Homogeneous coordinates $[X^0:X^1:X^2:X^3]$ are used to label points. Every line through the origin corresponds to a unique point in $\mathbb{RP}^3$. The space is inherently **scale–free**: multiplying all homogeneous coordinates by a constant leaves the point unchanged. This property formalises the idea that physics cares only about _ratios_ and _proportions_, not absolute magnitudes.

### 2.1 The Symmetry Group $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$

The group of projective linear transformations $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ acts transitively on $\mathbb{RP}^3$. Each element $P\in\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ is a linear automorphism of $\mathbb{R}^4$ modulo scalar rescaling. There are ten independent generators of this group:

- Three translations,
    
- Three rotations,
    
- Three projective shears/strains,
    
- One global dilation.
    

These generators correspond to the ten irreducible ways that matter can change in TEM, as will be elaborated in the **Universal Calculator**.

## 3. Why Expansion Is Necessary

In a universe governed by FPST any attempt to impose static geometry leads to contradictions. If the cardinalities of physical sets are fixed and the geometry does not expand, then as interactions proceed the finite number of allowable configurations is rapidly exhausted. The only way to support indefinitely many relational configurations within a finite universe is for the ambient geometry itself to stretch, creating new relational “slots” without violating finiteness.

Mathematically, this requirement manifests in the dynamics of $\mathbb{RP}^3$ through the **global dilation generator** of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$. Under a dilation by a factor $\lambda>0$ homogeneous coordinates transform as $X^\mu\mapsto \lambda X^\mu$. The geometric effect is to scale distances whilst preserving cross–ratios and the incidence structure. In TEM, **cosmic time** $t$ is identified with the logarithm of this dilation factor: $t = \ln \lambda$. Thus the passage of time is nothing other than the scale factor of the projective universe.

## 4. Volumetric Geometry and the Need for New Invariants

To make expansion mathematically precise we need to be able to compare volumes at different scales without reference to absolute size. Classical scalar quantities (like the standard Laplacian) depend on an absolute metric and thus break projective invariance. TEM instead constructs **volumetric invariants** that survive rescalings. The two most important are the **volumetric Laplacian** $\nabla_v^2$, a second‑order differential operator that commutes with all generators of $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$, and the **Volumetric Cross–Ratio (VCR)**, an integral functional that measures the relative arrangement of matter.

In later papers we prove that $\nabla_v^2$ and the VCR are unique under natural assumptions of locality and isotropy. They provide the mathematical machinery needed to express the constraints that give rise to the Rational Resonance Radix and the derivation of universal constants.

## 5. Conclusion

By rejecting the axiom of infinity and embedding physical reality in $\mathbb{RP}^3$ TEM arrives at the conclusion that expansion is not an empirical curiosity but an existential necessity. The FPST ensures that only finite configurations exist; the projective nature of space ensures that only ratios matter; and the ten–generator symmetry group $\mathrm{PGL}(4,\mathbb{R})$ provides the stage on which matter can transform. The existence of unique, scale–free volumetric invariants is the key that unlocks the subsequent structure of the theory.

The next paper, **TEM‑01**, develops the Volumetric Cross–Ratio in detail, proving its invariance and uniqueness. Together with the invariant Laplacian it forms the core mathematical toolkit from which the Rational Resonance Radix and the Universal Calculator emerge.
