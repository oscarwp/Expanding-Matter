# n ≈ 29 — Spiral / Vortex Configuration

## Summary

**Geometry:** Spiral or vortex-like configuration formed by \~29 balls
**Dimension:** 3D
**VCR (asserted in system):** 7/4
**Status:** Cited repeatedly across project documents as the onset of recursive spiral behavior
**Why here:** n = 29 is the first configuration in the radix associated with non-spherical, directionally recursive geometry.
**Open proof:** VCR = 7/4 has not been derived from geometry.

## Candidates

* **Recursive spiral or vortex (\~29 balls):** Cited in multiple documents as a configuration that transitions away from symmetric shells and into directionally coherent recursion. Described as the onset of spiral resonance. Treated as structurally distinct from prior n-values due to asymmetry.
* **Fixed 29-ball polyhedral shell:** Not proposed or observed. No geometric closure has been cited or tested. No reason to include as a candidate.

---

## Derivation (Planned)

Goal: Derive VCR = 7/4 from the recursive geometry of a spiral or vortex configuration composed of approximately 29 elements. Identify Ψ₁–Ψ₆ across helical or arcing paths that reflect recurrence or pitch symmetry.

---

## Decisions

* ✅ Accepted: Spiral/vortex configuration as primary structure at n = 29
* 🟡 Open: Geometric derivation of VCR = 7/4

---

## Working Notes

**Next Actions:**

* Attempt physical modeling of recursive spiral using magnet-ball chain
* Define curvature, pitch, or segment symmetry to frame a candidate cross-ratio derivation
* Investigate how the spiral connects structurally to preceding shells (n = 12) and subsequent higher-n growth
