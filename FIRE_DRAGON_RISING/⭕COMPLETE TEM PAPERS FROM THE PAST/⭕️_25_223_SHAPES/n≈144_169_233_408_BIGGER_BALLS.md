# n ≈ 144–408 — Macro-Scale Stable Spheres

---

## Summary

**Geometry:** Large, stable spherical configurations formed by continued accretion beyond n ≈ 90
**Dimension:** 3D
**VCRs (asserted in system):**

* n ≈ 144 → 8/3
* n = 169 → 13/1
* n = 233 → 13/8
* n = 408 → 1
  **Status:** Affirmed across system documents as recursive expansions of previously stable structures
  **Why here:** These configurations extend the recursive hierarchy established by lower stable forms. They arise naturally when the complete stable sphere at n ≈ 90 continues accreting without undergoing destabilizing division.
  **Open proof:** These values are derived in the system as necessary macro-stable solutions. Geometry is not specified per configuration but is treated as volumetric expansions of previous recursive seed shapes.

## Candidates

* **Volumetric spherical expansions (n ≈ 144 to 408):** These shapes are not uniquely constructed forms like n = 5 or n = 12. They are coherent recursive continuations in which stability is maintained through volumetric symmetry and resonance saturation.

## Derivation (Known)

All four of these values appear in the complete set of 14 stable configurations. They are solutions to the recursive constraint equations with rational VCR values and are derived from either Pell-Silver scaling (volumetric) or Fibonacci-Phi scaling (surface). Their inclusion is required by the Projective Completeness Theorem.

## Decisions

* ✅ Accepted: n ≈ 144, 169, 233, 408 as stable configurations
* ✅ Accepted: These represent macro-scale stability following n ≈ 90

## Working Notes

**Next Actions:**

* Identify potential physical meaning or emergent behaviors of these configurations
* Analyze when these shapes divide (via recursive collapse) versus continue accumulating
* Determine whether any of these are suitable as recursive seed shapes for larger domain structures
