# n = 5 — Pentagon, Ring of Balls, (Planar)

## Summary

**Geometry:** Planar pentagon of five balls
**Dimension:** 2D
**VCR (asserted in system):** 3/2
**Status:** Physically constructed and referenced by name in project documents
**Why here:** This is the first planar lock in the radix sequence. It is geometrically stable and symbolically affirmed.
**Open proof:** VCR = 3/2 has not been derived from the geometry.

## Candidates

* **Planar pentagon (5 balls):** Formed by connecting five magnetic spheres in a flat ring. Stable under perturbation. Named “The Pentagon” at n = 5 in *Gemini Talks*.

---

## Derivation (Planned)

Goal: derive VCR = 3/2 by assigning Ψ₁–Ψ₆ across edge distances or diagonals within the pentagon and constructing the cross-ratio accordingly.

---

## Decisions

* ✅ Accepted: Planar pentagon configuration
* 🟡 Open: Derivation of VCR = 3/2

---

## Working Notes

**Next Actions:**

* Build a candidate derivation from ball-to-ball edge geometry
* Attempt to define a compositional link between n = 5 and n = 12
* Consider whether this shape functions as a recursive unit in larger configurations

**Fine-structure constant equation (from RM Appendix 1):**
The inverse of the fine-structure constant (α⁻¹) is approximated by:
α⁻¹ = (n₅ / n₁₂) × (φ / τ) × (F₈ / P₃)

Where:

* **α** is the fine-structure constant (≈ 1/137)
* `n₅ / n₁₂`: resonance scaling between two stable shape configurations
* `φ / τ`: ratio between golden and silver means
* `F₈ / P₃`: recursive indexing constants
