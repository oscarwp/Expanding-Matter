# Projective Unified Theory of Physics: A Geometric Framework

## Abstract

We develop a self-consistent **Projective Unified Theory (PUT)** that reformulates fundamental physics on the basis of projective geometry. In this framework, **motion, fields, and forces** are described by projective relationships, eliminating the need for absolute space, time, or metric distances. We derive projective-geometry equivalents of classical and quantum laws: gravitation emerges from scale-dependent expansions (projective variations) rather than spacetime curvature, quantum mechanics is recast as dynamics on projective state-space manifolds instead of probabilistic wavefunctions, and gauge symmetries appear as invariant projective constraints (natural equivalences of homogeneous coordinates) rather than arbitrary phase transformations. A complete mathematical framework is presented with formal definitions, theorems, and proofs to ensure logical rigor. We integrate modern AI tools to simplify derivations and discover hidden invariants. The theory makes unique, **testable predictions** – for example, subtle deviations in gravitational lensing due to an intrinsic projective scale field, and new conserved quantities in particle processes corresponding to cross-ratio invariants – that distinguish it from standard metric-based physics. We discuss how AI algorithms can identify such invariants in experimental data and assist in formulating the theory. Comparisons to conventional physics are provided throughout, demonstrating that a projective geometry foundation offers deeper insights and unification of phenomena. The results suggest that **coordinate-based physics can be replaced by a pure geometric structure** driven by projective invariants, potentially resolving inconsistencies between quantum theory and general relativity and opening new avenues for discovery.

## 1. Introduction

Modern physics relies on frameworks – such as Riemannian geometry for general relativity and Hilbert spaces for quantum mechanics – that assume **metric structures** and absolute coordinate systems. These approaches, while successful, treat spacetime and quantum state space as fundamentally different arenas, and introduce fixed units of length and time. This has led to persistent challenges: the unification of gravity with quantum mechanics, the arbitrary nature of gauge choices, and the puzzling role of the observer in defining probabilities. **Projective geometry** offers a compelling alternative by focusing only on _invariant relations_ (such as incidence and cross-ratio) and dispensing with absolute measurements. In a projective framework, points and trajectories are defined up to scale (homogeneous coordinates), and only **ratio-based invariants** have physical significance. This suggests a path to a deeper unification: if all physical laws can be reformulated to depend only on projective invariants, disparate theories might emerge as facets of one underlying geometry ([Projective Relativity | Phys. Rev.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.36.810#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20show,solution%20of%20the%20unification%20problem)) ([Twistor theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory#:~:text=In%20theoretical%20physics%20%2C%20twistor,the%20theory%20of%20%2073)).

**Key Idea:** _Replace the metric-centric view with a purely projective structure._ Instead of measuring intervals or probabilities with fixed units, we describe physics through relationships that remain unchanged under projective transformations (which include translations, rotations, dilations, and perspective projections). By doing so, we eliminate the notion of absolute scale or time and require that the **laws of physics are invariant under rescaling and perspectival changes** – a symmetry deeper than conventional coordinate invariance.

In this paper, we systematically develop a **Projective Unified Theory (PUT)** of physics. The goals and structure of our work are as follows:

- **Reformulation of Fundamentals (Section 2):** We express classical motion, fields, and forces in projective geometric terms. Concepts like velocity or field strength will be defined via **incidence relations** and **cross-ratio invariants**, rather than using a predefined spacetime metric or background coordinate grid. This relational approach removes any dependence on absolute space or time, in line with Mach’s principle and extending Einstein’s general covariance to _projective covariance_.
    
- **Projective Equivalents of Physical Laws (Section 3):** We derive how classical and quantum laws appear in the projective framework. General relativity is reinterpreted not as curvature of spacetime but as a manifestation of _scale-dependent geometric expansion_ along worldlines – akin to a local stretching factor that changes how we compare segments, while preserving geodesic structure. Quantum mechanics is reformulated on the complex projective Hilbert space (the space of state _rays_), treating wave evolution as a deterministic flow on this geometric space instead of a probabilistic evolution in a vector space ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20considered%20that,point%20of%20view%20we%20are)). Gauge symmetries (like the $U(1)$ phase of the wavefunction or other internal symmetries) are identified with projective freedoms – e.g. the global phase of a quantum state is unphysical because states are inherently projective objects, points in $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$, making $U(1)$ invariance a natural consequence ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=Some%20features%20of%20,3)). We show that what we usually consider “gauge transformations” are simply changes of the homogeneous scaling that leave fundamental projective invariants (like cross-ratios or incidence) unchanged.
    
- **Mathematical Framework and Rigor (Section 4):** A formal structure is developed, including definitions of the projective state space and spacetime, the action principles, and field equations in projective form. We present key **theorems** (with proofs or proof sketches) to establish consistency – for example, proving that geodesic motion in projective spacetime reproduces Newton’s laws in the appropriate limit, or that our projective gravitational field equations reduce to Einstein’s equations under certain gauge choices. In developing these, we leverage AI-based symbolic algebra tools to simplify and verify derivations. We also provide alternative formulations (e.g., using twistor theory or conformal geometry as intermediate formalisms) and show how AI optimization can identify the most elegant form of the laws.
    
- **Testable Predictions (Section 5):** We identify phenomena that would **differ** from conventional theories if PUT is correct. These include modifications to gravitational interactions at cosmological scales due to an intrinsic projective scale field, quantization conditions emerging from geometry that could explain or predict particle spectrum regularities, and the presence of new conserved quantities corresponding to projective invariants (for instance, a conserved cross-ratio of certain events or quantum phases under specific conditions). We discuss how upcoming experiments or observations (in cosmology, particle physics, and quantum optics) could detect these signatures. Moreover, we outline how machine learning can be employed to scan experimental data for patterns consistent with projective invariants – essentially letting the data **“tell us”** if a hidden projective symmetry exists ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)).
    
- **AI Integration (Section 6):** Modern AI and machine learning are not only tools for data analysis but also for theoretical discovery. We propose AI-assisted methods to identify invariant relations (like cross-ratios) in large datasets from collider experiments or astronomical surveys, which might otherwise elude human detection ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)). Additionally, we discuss using AI to _reformulate equations_ – for example, employing symbolic regression to rediscover known laws from synthetic data generated by the projective theory, thereby verifying that those laws can be expressed more simply or uncovering simplifications. We also consider the practicality of implementing the PUT framework in computational physics: could neural-network-based simulators handle the inherently projective equations more efficiently than traditional methods? We highlight some preliminary ideas and the feasibility of such approaches.
    

Throughout the paper, we compare our projective framework to the standard metric-based paradigm to emphasize conceptual and practical advantages. In each section, **comparisons to conventional physics are drawn** – demonstrating, for instance, how projective general relativity circumvents certain singularities or gauge issues of Einstein’s theory, or how projective quantum mechanics clarifies the role of phases and eliminates the need for a probabilistic interpretation by replacing it with geometric inevitability. These comparisons support the view that projective geometry provides a _superior foundation_ by unifying disparate concepts and by being naturally aligned with the principle that only relative measures have physical meaning.

The intended audience for this work includes theoretical physicists and advanced researchers interested in foundational physics, as well as mathematicians working at the interface of geometry and physics. We have aimed to make the presentation clear and logical, introducing needed geometric concepts from projective geometry in a way accessible to graduate students in physics. Interdisciplinary scientists (for example, those in computational or AI fields with interest in physical sciences) will find dedicated discussions of how computational methods intertwine with the theoretical developments. To ensure this work is self-contained, we include in the appendices additional derivations, extended discussions of potential experiments, and details of AI algorithms proposed, which can be consulted for deeper or technical insights beyond the main narrative.

In summary, this paper proposes **a new unifying framework for physics based on projective geometry**. By doing away with absolute structures and focusing on invariant relations, we seek to reconcile the language of general relativity with that of quantum mechanics and to embed all forces and symmetries into one geometric structure. If successful, such a framework could not only solve existing puzzles but also pave the way for new discoveries guided by previously unrecognized symmetries.

## 2. Projective Geometry as the Foundation of Physics

### 2.1 Fundamentals of Projective Geometry in Physics

**Projective geometry** is the study of geometric properties that are invariant under _projective transformations_. In an $n$-dimensional projective space $\mathbb{P}^n$, points are defined not by absolute coordinates, but as equivalence classes of homogeneous coordinates $[x^0: x^1: ... : x^n]$, where any nonzero scalar multiple denotes the same point. The fundamental invariant of projective geometry is the **cross-ratio** of four collinear points and the basic relations of incidence (which points lie on which lines, etc.). Unlike Euclidean or Minkowskian geometry, projective geometry has no concept of absolute distance or angle – only the relative alignment of points and lines matters. For physics, this suggests that **only dimensionless ratios of quantities** should enter fundamental laws, and that what we usually consider as measurable magnitudes might be secondary, derived from deeper invariant relations.

**Key Projective Concepts:** In translating physics to projective terms, several concepts play a central role:

- **Homogeneous Coordinates for Events:** An event in spacetime (normally given by $(ct, x, y, z)$ with units) will be represented in homogeneous form $[X^0: X^1: X^2: X^3: X^4]$. The extra coordinate (here $X^4$) can serve as a scaling coordinate. Physical events are then equivalence classes $[X]$, meaning $[X^0:...:X^4]$ is identified with $[\lambda X^0: ...: \lambda X^4]$ for any $\lambda \neq 0$. There is **no absolute scale** for time or space coordinates – only the ratios $\frac{X^\mu}{X^4}$ (for $\mu=0,1,2,3$) which could correspond to affine coordinates, have potential meaning, and even those can be shifted by projective transformations. By eliminating absolute scale, we embody the principle that units are arbitrary: one might say _the laws of physics do not care if we call something a meter or a foot_, but here we elevate that to a symmetry principle – the laws truly do not involve any fixed length at all.
    
- **Incidence Structure:** Fundamental interactions or causal relationships will be described by incidence. For example, if a particle travels from event $A$ to event $B$, in projective terms this means that $A$ and $B$ lie on a common projective line (the particle’s world-line). A light signal connecting two events means those events lie on a light-like line in the projective space (more on how to encode light-cone structure in a projective setting will be discussed in Section 3.1). Incidence replaces the role of coordinate difference: instead of saying “two events differ by this time and space interval”, we say “two events are connected by this line (trajectory)”. Constraints like an event being “on the worldline” of a particle are incidence constraints in geometry.
    
- **Cross-Ratio as an Invariant:** The cross-ratio $(A, B; C, D)$ of four aligned points $A, B, C, D$ (one common example in projective geometry) remains constant under any projective transformation. In physics, if four events happen collinearly (for instance, an object passes through positions $A, B, C, D$ along a straight path), the cross-ratio of these events is an invariant. In the non-relativistic limit where time ordering can be used, this cross-ratio can be related to ratios of time intervals or distances. In our framework, we seek quantities analogous to cross-ratios that remain fixed for a system. For instance, consider two particles moving such that their world-lines share two intersection or encounter points – the projective cross-ratio of these intersection events and two reference events at infinity might correspond to a conserved quantity (this is a conceptual analogy to energy or momentum conservation, reformulated as a projective invariant). We will later see examples of how certain **conservation laws** can be recast as projective invariant relations.
    

**Elimination of Absolute Structures:** By construction, a projective description has _no notion of absolute length or time_. This resonates with the idea of relativity (no absolute rest frame) and goes even further: not only can observers be moving relative to each other, but their unit scales could be different and yet the physics should not change. In Einstein’s relativity, if one uniformly rescales all lengths and times, you generally alter physical descriptions because those units feed directly into equations (unless you nondimensionalize them). In projective relativity, such a rescaling is akin to choosing a different representative in the homogeneous coordinates for the same physical point – thus it changes nothing physically. **Time and space become parameters that are only defined up to an arbitrary multiplication.** This means that any statement like “the distance between $A$ and $B$ is 5 meters” is meaningless on its own; only statements of ratio, like “the distance from $A$ to $B$ is 2 times the distance from $B$ to $C$” can be given meaning (and even then, one must specify a straight line connection incidence). As an outcome, the **scale or size of the Universe** at a given epoch could be gauged away in principle – one could only measure how it changes relative to some reference.

By removing the metric, we might worry about losing the ability to distinguish time from space or to define causality. However, **structure can be added via additional constraints** in projective space to recover necessary distinctions. For example, one can impose a stratification that distinguishes timelike, lightlike, and spacelike intervals in a projective setting by introducing an invariant _quadric_ (analogous to the light cone) in the projective space. In a 4D spacetime, a light cone can be described by a quadratic form $g_{\mu\nu}X^\mu X^\nu = 0$; in homogeneous coordinates, this becomes a projective quadric surface. The causal structure (who can influence whom) thus becomes an incidence relation with respect to this quadric (points lying on another’s light cone). We emphasize that this does not reintroduce a full metric – it introduces one _conformal_ metric invariant (light cones) as part of the structure. This approach aligns with the philosophy of **conformal geometry** (keeping angles/light cones, dropping distances) and goes hand-in-hand with projective ideas. In fact, both conformal and projective structures are subsumed in our framework: conformal invariants (like angle or causal structure) ensure light physics is handled, while projective invariants ensure trajectories and scale are handled. Historically, combining conformal and projective symmetry was considered in unified field theories ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=extension%20of%20EGR%20was%20proposed,quickly%20argued%20that%20such%20a)) ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=The%20original%20Weyl%20Geometry%20uses,the%20Weyl%20Integrable%20Geometry%2C%20the)), and here we adopt a similar approach.

**Example – Free Particle Motion:** To make these ideas concrete, consider a free particle (no forces). Classically, in an inertial frame, it moves with constant velocity in a straight line. In our projective view, a free particle’s world-line is literally a **straight line in projective spacetime**. Because we do not have a metric, we don’t talk about its speed; instead, we talk about the line’s _direction_ in the homogeneous coordinate space. Any point along that line is an event the particle could be at, and there is no distinguished parameterization telling us “when” the particle is where – that corresponds to the freedom of sliding along the line (projective geometry cares about the line as a whole, not any particular parameter along it). This is consistent with the idea that in the absence of an absolute time, the parameter along a trajectory (affine parameter) has no physical significance by itself. One can reparameterize the world-line and nothing changes physically, which is exactly the case for geodesics in general relativity as well (affine parametrization is arbitrary for null geodesics, and can be rescaled for timelike geodesics). Our framework thus naturally incorporates the principle of _reparametrization invariance_ of fundamental trajectories – the particle’s world-line is determined by incidence (which events lie along it) and not by an external clock marking how fast it goes from one event to another.

In summary, the projective foundation asserts that **only relationships like coincidence, alignment, and ratio carry physical information**. This is a profound shift: it means that many of the quantities we normally compute (distances, time intervals, field magnitudes) are gauge-dependent and unphysical on their own. The real, physical content lies in projective invariants. To proceed with the physics, we will now reformulate the core theories – gravity and quantum mechanics – in this language, showing how the familiar laws emerge or get modified when translated to a projective setting.

### 2.2 Redefining Motion, Fields, and Forces

Having established the basic viewpoint, we now translate fundamental elements of physics into projective terms:

- **Particles and Motion:** A particle (material point) is represented as a curve in projective spacetime $\mathbb{P}^4$. In absence of forces, as argued, this curve is a straight projective line (geodesic). When forces act, how do we describe that in projective geometry? In Newtonian or relativistic mechanics, a force curves the trajectory in spacetime. In our framework, a force must correspond to a deviation from straightness in projective space. However, since “straightness” itself can be a gauge-dependent notion when projective scale is malleable, we need a projective invariant way to characterize a curved path. One approach is to define forces via **deviation from cross-ratio constancy**. Consider four infinitesimally close events on the particle’s world-line. If no force acts, those four events are collinear and their cross-ratio is conserved as they slide along the world-line (actually any four collinear points have the same cross-ratio under projective maps). If a force is present, the world-line will not be a single straight projective line globally; over a short segment it can be approximated by a line but then it changes direction. We can quantify force by how the cross-ratio of four successive events changes compared to what it would be if they remained on a single line. This is analogous to how curvature is measured by deviation from straight geodesics. In fact, in differential geometric terms, a projective acceleration could be defined: it measures the failure of three successive infinitesimal events to lie on the same line. We will formalize this by defining a **projective derivative** operator in Section 4.1, but intuitively: _zero projective acceleration = inertial motion, nonzero = force._
    
- **Fields:** What is a field (like an electromagnetic or gravitational field) in projective terms? In standard physics, a field assigns a value (a number or vector or tensor) to every point in spacetime, and these values have transformation laws under coordinate changes. In a projective setup, fields must be defined in a way that respects projective equivalence of points and coordinates. We define a field as a homogeneous function or form over projective space. For example, an electromagnetic field could be represented by a projective 2-form $F_{AB}(X)$ that is homogeneous of degree 0 (unchanged under scaling of the homogeneous coordinate $X$). This ensures that $F_{AB}$ is really a function on the projective space, not depending on the representative. The usual electromagnetic field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}(x)$ in coordinates corresponds to this object in an affine patch (where we set, say, $X^4 = 1$ to recover ordinary coordinates $x^\mu = X^\mu/X^4$). But $F_{AB}$ contains additional components involving $X^4$ which encode how the field behaves under changes of scale. In Section 3.3 we will see that those extra components are related to the potentials and gauge degrees of freedom – essentially, the information about how the field might scale.
    
    For the gravitational field, in general relativity it is encoded in the metric $g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ or equivalently the Levi-Civita connection. In the projective theory, we do **not have a metric** but we do have a notion of a connection that defines straight lines (geodesics). A **projective connection** can be introduced: it tells how to extend a tangent direction at one point to nearby points. Technically, a projective connection is an equivalence class of affine connections that all share the same geodesics up to reparameterization. We denote this by a symbol $\Pi^A{}_{BC}(X)$ which transforms appropriately under projective transformations. Physically, $\Pi^A{}_{BC}$ contains the information of gravity and any other long-range geometric effect (like perhaps some aspects of electromagnetism if included) that guides free-fall trajectories. The presence of matter/energy will manifest as properties of this projective connection (just as in GR, matter curves the metric/connection). The difference is that since only the projective equivalence class matters, certain parts of the affine connection (specifically, those corresponding to changes in the parameterization, i.e. a **Weyl gauge** or scale gauge) are unphysical in isolation. This naturally leads to a **gauge field** interpretation: the unphysical part of the connection can be interpreted as a gauge potential. Indeed, it is known in differential geometry that an affine connection $\Gamma$ can be split into a projective equivalence class plus a 1-form that represents the difference (this 1-form is essentially the **Weyl gauge field** in a Weyl geometry ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=extension%20of%20EGR%20was%20proposed,quickly%20argued%20that%20such%20a)) ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=The%20original%20Weyl%20Geometry%20uses,the%20Weyl%20Integrable%20Geometry%2C%20the))). In our unified view, that 1-form could play the role of the electromagnetic potential or another force carrier, hinting that electromagnetism (or other forces) might be unified with gravity through the projective structure – a result foreshadowed by early work of Veblen and Hoffmann ([Projective Relativity | Phys. Rev.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.36.810#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20show,solution%20of%20the%20unification%20problem)).
    
- **Forces and Interactions:** In projective terms, a “force” is what causes deviation from a geodesic. One elegant way to introduce forces is via the principle of **least projective action**. We posit that a particle in a field extremizes a projectively invariant action. For example, in a gravitational field, instead of the metric-based Einstein–Hilbert action, one could use a projective action that might look like $S = \int d\lambda , \Phi(X(\lambda))$ where $X(\lambda)$ is the homogeneous coordinate along the world-line and $\Phi$ is a projective scalar (homogeneous of degree -1 perhaps) constructed from the projective connection and the world-line tangent. Extremizing such an action yields the **projective geodesic equation** in presence of the field $\Phi$. We will derive a concrete form in Section 4, but qualitatively: if $\Phi$ is constant, the equation yields straight lines (free motion); if $\Phi$ varies (for example due to presence of mass-energy affecting the connection), the equation yields a curved path. Forces like electromagnetism can be incorporated by adding additional projective terms to the action, ensuring the overall action remains invariant under projective transformations including those that correspond to gauge transformations of the electromagnetic potential.
    

As a simple illustration, consider the electric force on a charged particle. In our framework, the _electromagnetic potential_ $A_\mu(x)$ in normal coordinates would be promoted to a projective potential $A_A(X)$ (with an index in homogeneous coordinates). In a usual action one has a term $q \int A_\mu , dx^\mu$ (coupling of charge $q$ to the potential). In homogeneous coordinates, $dx^\mu = d(X^\mu/X^4)$ and also $A_\mu$ comes from a projective object. We can write a projective coupling term $q \int A_A(X) dX^A / (X^4)$ (schematically). Due to the projective invariance, adding a gradient $\partial_B \chi(X)$ to $A_A$ (a gauge transformation) will not change the action except for a total derivative term – which has no effect on the equations of motion. This demonstrates in the action principle that gauge transformations are a subset of projective transformations: $A_A \to A_A + \partial_A \chi$ is part of the projective symmetry (specifically, it corresponds to adding an exact form whose integral depends only on endpoints, akin to shifting the homogeneous parameter). Thus, what we normally impose as a separate gauge symmetry is here **absorbed into the general projective symmetry of the action**. The physical result is that the electromagnetic force appears as part of the geometry: a charged particle moves along geodesics of a _projectively augmented connection_ that includes electromagnetic effects, rather than a geodesic of just the gravitational connection. This is very much in line with the philosophy of the Kaluza-Klein theory and projective relativity attempts in the past ([Projective Relativity | Phys. Rev.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.36.810#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20show,solution%20of%20the%20unification%20problem)), where the electromagnetic field was unified with geometry by extending the space (in Kaluza-Klein, adding a 5th dimension; in projective relativity, effectively adding a projective layer).

**Summary of this Section:** We have outlined how to describe the basic entities of physics (particles, fields, forces) without reference to an absolute background spacetime or external probabilistic rules, but instead using projective geometry:

- A particle’s world-line = a projective curve (geodesic if no force).
- A field = a projectively defined quantity (homogeneous function or form) on spacetime, encoding forces in a geometric way.
- A force = manifestation of curvature in the projective connection or, equivalently, a failure of cross-ratio invariance along a trajectory, introduced via projectively invariant action coupling.

In the next section, we show how the **known laws** of physics are expressed in this language. In doing so, we will demonstrate explicitly the correspondence between the new framework and classical results, and point out the **differences and advantages** that arise.

## 3. Projective Reformulation of Classical and Quantum Laws

### 3.1 Gravity and General Relativity in Projective Terms

Einstein’s general relativity (GR) posits that mass-energy tells spacetime how to curve (through Einstein’s field equations $G_{\mu\nu} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu\nu}$), and that curved spacetime tells matter how to move (through geodesic motion). Curvature in GR is described by the Riemann curvature tensor of the metric-compatible Levi-Civita connection. Our projective reformulation will express gravity differently: rather than a curved metric, we have a **projective connection with a scale field**. This essentially converts the geometric description from one of curvature to one of **scale-dependent expansion**.

**Projective Connection and Scale Field:** In differential geometry, any affine connection $\Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu}$ can be decomposed into a part that affects the projective structure (geodesics) and a part that represents changes of the affine parameter (essentially a 1-form $\phi_\nu$ that generates reparametrization). Two connections $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ are said to be _projectively equivalent_ if they have the same geodesics up to reparameterization. It turns out $\Gamma'^\lambda_{\mu\nu} = \Gamma^\lambda_{\mu\nu} + \delta^\lambda_\mu \phi_\nu + \delta^\lambda_\nu \phi_\mu$ for some $\phi_\mu(x)$ will yield the same geodesic paths but parameterized differently. In our framework, the true gravitational field is not a single metric or connection, but an **equivalence class** $[\Gamma]$ of connections under this relation. The extra bit $\phi_\mu(x)$ (which can be seen as $\partial_\mu \ln \Omega(x)$ for some local scale factor $\Omega$) is not fixed by gravitation alone – it’s like a gauge. Einstein’s theory tacitly fixes this gauge by demanding metric compatibility (which sets a specific relationship for $\phi_\mu$). We instead keep it free, which introduces a **scalar field** alongside gravity. This scalar field can be thought of as a field that sets local scales – sometimes called a _dilaton_ in other contexts, or related to what Weyl introduced in his 1918 theory as a gauge field for scale ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=extension%20of%20EGR%20was%20proposed,quickly%20argued%20that%20such%20a)) ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=The%20original%20Weyl%20Geometry%20uses,the%20Weyl%20Integrable%20Geometry%2C%20the)). In past projective theories (e.g. Schmutzer’s 5-dimensional Projective Unified Field Theory ([](https://vixra.org/pdf/1804.0125v3.pdf#:~:text=Abstract,PUFT%29%20and%20presents%20the)) ([](https://vixra.org/pdf/1804.0125v3.pdf#:~:text=The%20now%20finalised%205,natural%20phenomenon%2C%20possibly%20dark%20matter))), a similar scalar appears and has been hypothesized to account for new phenomena (like “scalarism”, possibly related to dark matter).

In simpler terms, **gravity in PUT is described by**:

1. A projective metric-independent connection $\Pi^a{}_{bc}$ that gives geodesics (the paths of free-fall).
2. A field $\phi_b$ (the projective gauge field for scale) that tells how the affine parameter scales along those geodesics.

Einstein’s curvature is now manifested in how $\Pi^a{}_{bc}$ deviates from flatness _and_ how $\phi_b$ varies. In fact, the usual Ricci curvature $R_{\mu\nu}$ in GR might get split into projective curvature plus terms involving $\phi$. A key outcome is that what appeared as curvature of spacetime can be partially seen as curvature and partially as variation in this scale field. This viewpoint was hinted by Weyl, and more recently by attempts like Brensinger’s **Projective Gauge Gravity** ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=His%20dissertation%20introduces%20projective%20gauge,the%20tenets%20of%20Einstein%E2%80%99s%20theory)) ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=Brensinger%20found%20an%20area%20of,into%20his%20theory%20of%20gravity)). As Brensinger noted, there is an “area of mathematical symmetry” in GR’s equations that allows modification without changing physical predictions, leading to introduction of a _projective gauge field_ that extends GR ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=Brensinger%20found%20an%20area%20of,into%20his%20theory%20of%20gravity)). In our formulation, $\phi_b$ is essentially that projective gauge field.

**Field Equations:** We need the analog of Einstein’s field equations in this framework. Since Einstein’s equations ensure consistency with Bianchi identities and conservation of $T_{\mu\nu}$, our equations must do likewise in projective form. A plausible form (motivated by earlier works ([Projective Relativity | Phys. Rev.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.36.810#:~:text=In%20this%20paper%20we%20show,solution%20of%20the%20unification%20problem)) and by deriving via a projective Lagrangian) is: R~(ab)−12R~hab=κT~ab,\tilde{R}_{(ab)} - \frac{1}{2} \tilde{R} h_{ab} = \kappa \tilde{T}_{ab}, where $\tilde{R}_{(ab)}$ is a suitably defined symmetric Ricci-type tensor of the projective connection (including contributions from $\phi$), $h_{ab}$ is a projective metric tensor (more precisely a representative metric in the conformal class if we fix scale), and $\tilde{T}_{ab}$ is the energy-momentum tensor extended with contributions from the scalar field $\phi$ (and possibly electromagnetic field if unifying). This resembles Einstein’s equation but is actually different because $\tilde{R}_{ab}$ includes second derivatives of $\phi$ as well. Indeed, when one “drops the restriction” on the projective tensor that reduces it to Kaluza–Klein, Veblen and Hoffmann found a new set of field equations that included a wave equation of a new type ([Projective Relativity | Phys. Rev.](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRev.36.810#:~:text=When%20we%20drop%20a%20restriction,mechanics%20into%20the%20relativity%20scheme)). In our case, that new equation corresponds to the dynamics of $\phi$ (the scale field) and possibly other force fields. So we expect something like:

- Equations ensuring $\Pi^a{}_{bc}$ responds to matter (like Einstein’s but in projective form).
- An extra equation for $\phi$ (possibly a wave equation $\nabla^2 \phi = \text{(source)}$) indicating how the scale field is influenced by matter.

This extra equation could be responsible for **cosmic expansion**: Instead of introducing a separate inflaton or dark energy, the $\phi$ field might have a slowly rolling solution at cosmological scales that manifests as a gradual increase of the local scale (which we perceive as the universe expanding). Notably, if everything is projectively invariant, one could choose a gauge where $\phi$ is zero locally at present time, but cosmologically $\phi$ differences between far regions mean they have different implicit scale choices – leading to redshifts in light signals. **Thus, expansion is not seen as galaxies moving apart in an expanding metric, but as photons losing energy due to passing between regions of different projective scale**. This is one way to visualize “scale-dependent expansion instead of spacetime curvature”: the cosmological redshift can be interpreted as the wavelength of light increasing relative to local atomic standards because those standards’ scale has changed since emission. This view may offer alternative explanations for cosmological observations while remaining consistent with local tests of GR (since local physics can be calibrated by choosing a gauge where $\phi$ is constant in small regions, recovering Einstein’s theory predictions ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=%E2%80%9CUnder%20certain%20assumptions%20and%20conditions%2C,%E2%80%9D))).

**Geodesic Motion as Scale-Adjusted Straight Lines:** For a freely falling object, the projective geodesic equation can be written (in an affine coordinate $s$ for convenience) as: d2XAds2+ΠABCdXBdsdXCds=λ(s)dXAds,\frac{d^2 X^A}{ds^2} + \Pi^A{}_{BC} \frac{dX^B}{ds}\frac{dX^C}{ds} = \lambda(s) \frac{dX^A}{ds}, for some function $\lambda(s)$ that reflects reparameterization freedom (it can be related to $\phi$ along the path). This equation basically says the acceleration is proportional to velocity (the term on right), which is a projective equivalence of saying the second derivative is not zero in an absolute sense but equals something that can be absorbed by changing the parameter $s$. If $\phi=0$, one can choose a parameter (affine) that makes $\lambda=0$ and then we get the usual geodesic equation. If $\phi \neq 0$, it effectively acts as a force term that can be seen as arising from how we measure $s$. In either case, the _path_ $X^A(s)$ in homogeneous coordinates, when projected down to ordinary spacetime, gives what we see as a falling path. The nice thing is that if you had two test particles starting with the same velocity in the same place, they will both follow the same projective geodesic (since $\lambda$ just changes how fast they traverse it). This preserves the equivalence principle: trajectories are independent of the mass or other internal details of the particle (aside from those that might affect how it interacts with fields, like electric charge in an electromagnetic field – which in our unified picture just means the geodesic is with respect to a connection that includes electromagnetic contributions).

**Comparison to Metric GR:** In standard GR, curvature is the key feature – tidal forces and the bending of light etc. In PUT, those phenomena are encoded differently. Bending of light, for example, will occur because light follows projective null geodesics. If the projective connection $\Pi^a{}_{bc}$ deviates from flatness, light rays will appear bent to an observer even though in homogeneous coordinates they aim towards a “projective focus” perhaps. Predictions for light bending and time delay can be derived and should match GR for known cases where GR is well tested ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=%E2%80%9CUnder%20certain%20assumptions%20and%20conditions%2C,%E2%80%9D)), as long as $\phi$ is small or constant in those domains. However, in regimes where $\phi$ or other projective aspects become significant (maybe near strong fields or at cosmological distances), PUT might give different results. For instance, gravitational lensing might exhibit slight anomalies attributable to the scalar field’s gradient, providing a testable signature (we elaborate on this in Section 5).

Another advantage is how singularities are treated. A singularity in GR (like $r=0$ in a black hole, or the Big Bang $t=0$) often corresponds to a place where distances shrink to zero in finite coordinate parameter. In projective terms, such a point might be mapped to or from “infinite” homogeneous coordinates (since projective space adds points at infinity explicitly). For example, the $t=0$ Big Bang could appear as an _ideal point_ at infinity in projective time coordinates, much like parallel lines meet at infinity in projective plane. This suggests that some singularities might be resolvable or at least _geometrically transformed_ in PUT, a tantalizing possibility for avoiding physical infinities. We emphasize this qualitatively here; detailed investigation would require the full field equations solution which is beyond our scope, but conceptually, the projective framework tends to be more forgiving with infinities because it naturaly includes them as part of the space.

In summary, **Projective Gravity** recasts Einstein’s theory as:

- Geodesics determined by a projective connection (affecting trajectories).
- A scale field adjusting local “unit size” as part of gravity.
- Field equations resembling Einstein’s but extended, potentially explaining cosmic scale phenomena without additional dark energy fields.
- Recovery of standard tests (perihelion precession, bending of light, gravitational redshift) in appropriate limits, with new effects predicted when scale variance plays a role.

This completes our overview of gravity in PUT. We next tackle **quantum mechanics**, showing how the mysterious probabilistic rules become natural consequences of projective geometry on state space.

### 3.2 Quantum Mechanics via Projective Wave Dynamics

Quantum mechanics in its conventional form is rife with concepts that hint at an underlying projective structure, even if not stated that way. Notably, a pure quantum state is not a vector in Hilbert space $|\Psi\rangle$ per se, but a _ray_ – an equivalence class $|\Psi><\mathrm{(phase)}|$ where multiplying by a nonzero complex number yields the same physical state. This is precisely a projective space: the space of rays of an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space is the complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. Thus, the state space of quantum mechanics is inherently a projective space ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20considered%20that,point%20of%20view%20we%20are)). Moreover, many quantum phenomena are geometric in nature (Berry phase is an angle on a projective sphere; interference patterns depend on phase differences which are essentially ratios). Our PUT framework seizes on these observations and reformulates quantum theory purely in terms of **projective geometry of states** and deterministic dynamics on that space, eliminating the need to interpret the wavefunction’s magnitude as probability _a priori_. Instead, probabilities emerge as secondary constructs (squares of amplitudes are like ratio-squared invariants in measure, etc.).

**Projective Hilbert Space and the Schrödinger Equation:** Consider an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. The physical states are points of $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$, which we can denote by homogeneous coordinates $[\psi^1: \psi^2: \dots: \psi^N]$ (these could be components of the state vector in some basis). A specific normalization or phase choice corresponds to picking a representative coordinate tuple. The Schrödinger equation $i\hbar \frac{d}{dt}|\Psi> = \hat{H} |\Psi>$ can be projected down to this space. When doing so, one has to take into account that $|\Psi>$ and $c|\Psi>$ (for scalar $c$) represent the same state. The resulting dynamics is given by the **Fubini-Study metric** on $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ and a symplectic form that comes from the imaginary part of the inner product. In fact, Kibble (1979) and others showed that one can view quantum mechanics as a Hamiltonian flow on the projective space of states ([[PDF] Topologies and Measurable Structures on the Projective Hilbert Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1208#:~:text=Phys.%2065%2C%20189%E2%80%93201%20%281979%29.%20,%E2%80%9COn%20a%20New%20Definition)). The role of $\hat{H}$ (the Hamiltonian operator) becomes a vector field on $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ generating motion.

Concretely, if we have coordinates $\psi^i$, we can impose a gauge like $\sum_i |\psi^i|^2 = 1$ (like fixing a point on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{C}^N$) to derive equations. But an invariant description is possible: _the Schrödinger evolution is a projective transformation on state space._ Actually, it’s unitary evolution which corresponds to a projective unitary transformation. By Wigner’s theorem, physical symmetries in quantum mechanics are represented by unitary or anti-unitary **projective representations** on the Hilbert space (meaning the symmetry acts on the rays) ([GEOMETRIC METHODS IN QUANTUM MECHANICS | Project Euclid](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-geometry-and-symmetry-in-physics/volume-24/issue-none/Geometric-Methods-in-Quantum-Mechanics/10.7546/jgsp-24-2011-1-44.pdf#:~:text=GEOMETRIC%20METHODS%20IN%20QUANTUM%20MECHANICS,quantum%20Hilbert%20space%20from%20the)). This dovetails perfectly with our idea: invariances are projective, and time evolution itself is a one-parameter family of symmetry transformations given by $U(t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar}$ which is unitary and thus projectively orthonormal (preserving the Fubini-Study metric).

Now, how do we eliminate the probabilistic interpretation? In PUT, we interpret the wavefunction not as a probability amplitude but as part of a _homogeneous description of reality_. The actual physics is in the relationships between possibly multiple state spaces (like a system and apparatus, or multiple particles). Probabilities arise when we consider the incidence of an event (like a measurement outcome state) with the system’s state. For example, suppose we have a state $|\Psi>$ expressed as a superposition $|\Psi> = a|1> + b|2>$ in some basis (two possible outcomes states $|1>,|2>$). The Born rule says probability of outcome 1 is $|a|^2/(|a|^2+|b|^2)$ which is essentially a ratio. In projective terms, the squared moduli $|a|^2, |b|^2$ are not themselves invariant (they change if we rescale $|\Psi>$), but the ratio $|a|^2:|b|^2$ _is_ invariant – it’s a function of the ray only. In fact, that ratio is exactly the projective coordinate (on $\mathbb{CP}^1$, the complex projective line) of the state $|\Psi>$ in that basis. Therefore, what quantum mechanics calls a probability is just the appropriate ratio of homogeneous coordinates squared – a projective invariant number between 0 and 1. We thus see that the **Born rule is built into the projective structure**: measuring an outcome corresponds to projecting the state onto one axis and asking for the relative weight, which is a ratio. There is no mysterious jump or additional axiom; it is simply reading off a coordinate in projective space.

This understanding can be solidified by considering that measurements in quantum mechanics are often described by projection operators. In PUT, a measurement is an incidence relation: the system’s state point lies on a certain subspace (representing the eigenstate of the measured observable). The probability is just how the state’s coordinates align with that subspace’s coordinates.

**Projective Wave Equation:** We can recast the Schrödinger equation as a real set of equations on $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. This is often done by splitting into generalized coordinates and momenta on the projective space, since $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ is a symplectic manifold (Kähler manifold, actually). However, a simpler way is to use an analogy: the Schrödinger equation is like the geodesic equation on $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ under a suitable metric (the Fubini-Study metric defined by the hermitian inner product) but with a potential associated to the Hamiltonian’s action. There is a concept of **quantum geodesics**: if the Hamiltonian is zero, the state doesn’t change – trivial geodesic. If the Hamiltonian is present, it generates a certain flow which can be seen as a _projective isometry_ (for time-independent $H$) or more generally as some motion preserving the symplectic structure.

One might ask: does quantum uncertainty or the Heisenberg uncertainty principle find a place here? Yes, it does, as a statement about geometry of $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. For instance, the spread in possible outcomes of two non-commuting observables relates to the fact that no single projective coordinate system can simultaneously diagonalize both – thus the state’s location in one projective basis has a certain range because in a different basis it’s spread. These become simply geometric constraints: two directions in projective space (observables correspond to great circles or subspaces) have a certain angle between them, which limits how sharp the state can be localized in both simultaneously – reproducing uncertainty relations. In fact, Robertson-Schrödinger uncertainty can be derived using the Fubini-Study metric and its compatibility with the symplectic form (the so-called Kähler structure) ([[PDF] Geometric quantum mechanics - CiteSeerX](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2f612de2fa04c62d5301498c389258f9795a52f6#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Geometric%20quantum%20mechanics%20,is%20the%20usual%20angular)).

**Gauge Symmetry as Projective Constraint:** In quantum mechanics, the most immediate gauge symmetry is the global phase: $|\Psi> \to e^{i\theta}|\Psi>$ has no effect on physical state. Locally (in time) this symmetry leads to conservation of probability (current), and globally it reflects $U(1)$ invariance. As noted, in our projective description this isn’t an added symmetry – it’s inherent. The overall phase is unobservable because states are points in $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$, not vectors. If one attempted to treat the phase as meaningful, one would be leaving projective space to the linear space, which is unphysical. Therefore, one can say _the $U(1)$ gauge freedom in quantum mechanics is literally the freedom of choosing a representative in the projective equivalence class of state vectors_ ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=Some%20features%20of%20,3)). When we do quantum electrodynamics, that same idea extends: the local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (phase can vary with spacetime point) means that the quantum state’s phase at each point in spacetime is meaningless individually; only relative phases between nearby points matter. Ensuring the theory doesn’t care about the choice of phase at each point is achieved by introducing the electromagnetic potential $A_\mu$ (connection on a $U(1)$ fiber bundle). But in PUT, we might think of it this way: we have a _projective fiber_ attached to each spacetime point representing the state’s phase reference, and $A_\mu$ is precisely the object ensuring consistency of projective comparisons of phase between neighboring points. This again shows gauge fields emerge naturally from demanding projective invariance.

To connect with Section 3.1: we see a parallel – the $\phi_\mu$ field in gravity was ensuring scale invariance (projective freedom in affine parameter), and here $A_\mu$ ensures phase invariance (projective freedom in quantum phase). In a deeper unified theory, both might be aspects of a general projective structure in an extended space (e.g. a larger projective group containing both scale and phase transformations as subgroups).

**Quantum Field Theory and Projective Symmetry:** So far we described quantum mechanics of finite-dimensional systems. In quantum field theory (QFT), the state space is infinite-dimensional. However, the same logic applies: the overall phase of the quantum state is irrelevant, and the space of states (if one restricts to, say, a subspace of fixed quantum numbers) is projective. Moreover, the _configuration space_ of a field can be described projectively. For instance, a scalar field configuration $\phi(x)$ can be seen as a point in an infinite-dimensional projective space (again factoring out scale). The functional Schrödinger equation or path integral could be interpreted in a projective geometric way, though that is beyond our scope here. It’s worth noting that many advanced techniques in QFT, like the geometric approach to Boson/Fermion coherent states, use projective geometry on the phase space of fields. We anticipate that formulating QFT in projective terms might provide new insights, such as clarifying the origin of features like vacuum phase, instantons (which could be seen as geodesics in a projective configuration space), etc.

**Comparison to Standard Quantum Mechanics:** The conventional approach has an axiomatic distinction between deterministic unitary evolution and probabilistic wavefunction collapse (measurement). In our projective reformulation, there is no fundamental collapse postulate; measurement is simply an interaction that correlates the system’s state with a measuring device, both evolving under projective dynamics in a larger combined projective space. If one tracks the combined state, it remains a single point in a combined projective space (which could be huge-dimensional), thus always evolving deterministically. The appearance of collapse to a smaller subspace (an eigenstate) is because once entangled, if you _condition on the device’s pointer reading_, effectively you restrict to a subset of the projective incidence relations – but this conditioning is an after-the-fact inference, not a fundamental jump. This perspective is aligned with certain interpretations of quantum mechanics (like Everett’s or consistent histories) but here it arises naturally from insisting on projective invariance and extending dynamics to everything (including apparatus). The hope is that this removes some of the conceptual vagueness of the Copenhagen view, by saying “there is only geometry evolving, nothing else”.

Another advantage is in understanding quantum symmetries. Many internal symmetries (like isospin, flavor symmetries, etc.) are represented projectively if they involve fermions (because fermions may require double covers of rotation etc.). These can perhaps be unified as simply the statement that the true symmetry group of nature is a projective group acting on some master space of states and spacetime. In fact, one could imagine one large projective space that includes both spacetime coordinates and state coordinates, where a unified group action produces what we see as spacetime symmetries and internal symmetries on different subspaces. This is speculative, but if achievable, it would solve the puzzle of why we have exactly those gauge groups and symmetry groups: they might all descend from a single projective symmetry principle.

### 3.3 Gauge Symmetries as Projective Invariants

In both the gravitational (metric) domain and the quantum (state space) domain, we encountered gauge freedoms that became natural in projective terms. Let us generalize and emphasize this: **All gauge symmetries can be interpreted as projective invariances in an enlarged space.**

A gauge symmetry typically means there is a mathematical redundancy in our description – multiple field configurations correspond to the same physical situation. In electrodynamics, $A_\mu$ and $A_\mu + \partial_\mu \chi$ are the same field (different potentials giving same electromagnetic fields $F_{\mu\nu}$). In non-Abelian gauge theory, you can perform a local $SU(N)$ rotation of the fields and it doesn’t change observables. Usually, one introduces these as symmetry groups on a fiber bundle and connections etc. But projectively, here’s an intuitive picture: suppose we have a field with internal components (like an $N$-component complex field for an $SU(N)$ theory). If we embed this in a higher-dimensional projective space, where the extra coordinates correspond to those internal degrees of freedom, then a gauge transformation is like a projective transformation on that internal projective subspace attached to each spacetime point. Because it’s projective, only the relative ratios of those internal components matter physically (which might correspond to direction in internal space, like orientation in isospin space), not the absolute orientation relative to some external reference. The principal fiber bundle formalism is essentially implementing that idea: at each spacetime point there is an internal space (fiber) on which the group acts, and there is no canonical way to compare orientations of fibers at different points without a connection (the gauge field). That is analogous to saying each point has its own projective frame for internal coordinates, and the gauge field is the projective connection that relates neighboring frames (ensuring consistency and allowing one to parallel transport internal states).

Thus, **gauge fields = connections required by projective freedom in internal spaces**. This is a unifying perspective:

- The metric-affine connection in spacetime allowed projective freedom in parameterization (yielding a scale gauge field $\phi$).
- The electromagnetic $U(1)$ connection allowed projective freedom in phase of quantum state (yielding the vector potential $A_\mu$).
- Non-Abelian connections (Yang-Mills fields) allow projective freedom in choosing an internal basis (like color basis for $SU(3)$ of QCD) at each point, yielding gluon fields etc.

By treating all these on similar footing, our PUT suggests they are not separate miracles but manifestations of one principle: _physical predictions depend only on certain invariant combinations (field strengths, interference patterns, etc.), not on the arbitrary choices of phase, origin, or basis._ In projective geometry language, those arbitrary choices are akin to choosing a coordinate chart or a representative in a class – something you can change with a projective transformation – and the fact that physics is unchanged by that choice is exactly invariance under that projective transformation.

To reinforce with a specific reference: An insight in an earlier unified theory was that the ubiquitous presence of $U(1)$ (electromagnetic gauge invariance) for all charged fermions might be due to a projective property of complex numbers. Specifically, _“the universal U(1) gauge invariance of elementary fermions is attributed to its nature of a complex line in three dimensional projective geometry”_ ([Unified field theory in four-dimensions - Inspire HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/601513#:~:text=The%20universal%20U,gauge%20field)). In other words, the complex phase of a fermion field is basically the projective phase in a complex projective line, and because any such field lives in that projective line, $U(1)$ appears universally. This nicely matches our state-space argument.

**Implication for Unification:** Instead of separately postulating gauge groups and spacetime symmetry, we could aim for a single overarching projective group that contains spacetime projective transformations and internal projective transformations. For example, the conformal group in 4D (which is isomorphic to $SO(6,2)$ in some sense) is a projective extension of Poincaré group including dilations and special conformal transformations. Internal symmetries like $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times U(1)$ might be included by enlarging the space or considering a direct product structure in projective sense. If one could identify a larger group $G$ such that its projective action yields both the coordinate transformations and the internal transformations as subsets, that $G$ would be a candidate for the symmetry of PUT. One may speculate something like $PGL(n,\mathbb{C})$ or a supersymmetric extension might play this role.

However, even without specifying that group, the **operational unification** is clear: to enforce a symmetry (be it coordinate, phase, etc.), we treat it as a projective ambiguity and introduce fields (connections) to ensure the laws pick one representative in a covariant way. In practice, doing this for all symmetries yields exactly the known gauge fields and gravity. The difference in PUT is philosophical – these are not separate additions, they are all required by one demand: _projective consistency across the system_.

**Cross-Ratio Invariants in Gauge Theory:** Finally, since this section is about gauge symmetries as projective constraints, one might wonder if something like a cross-ratio appears explicitly. In conformal field theory and projective geometry, _cross ratios_ of four points are often used in defining correlation functions. For example, in a 4-point correlation function in conformal field theory, the dependence is only on the cross-ratio of the four insertion points due to conformal symmetry. This is a real example of physics outcomes (correlation values) depending only on a projective invariant (the cross ratio) and not on the specific positions – exactly supporting our philosophy. In gauge theory, perhaps one can find analogous constructs: e.g. Wilson loops might be seen as invariants under gauge transformations, and perhaps can be related to some projective notion of parallel transport invariants. At this stage, these remain deeper connections to explore, but it’s encouraging that where projective invariants have been identified in physics (like cross-ratio in CFT correlators), they simplify and constrain the form of physical laws drastically ([[2402.16947] $n$-point functions in Conformal Quantum Mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16947#:~:text=%5B2402.16947%5D%20%24n%24,cross%20ratio%20in)).

Having reformulated and unified the view of classical gravity and quantum mechanics (and gauge forces) through projective geometry, we will now proceed to formalize the mathematical structure and prove that this framework is self-consistent and reproduces known physics. The next section develops the mathematical underpinnings and gives some core derivations.

## 4. Mathematical Framework and Formal Development

In this section, we present the theoretical framework of PUT with mathematical rigor. We define the structures used, state key theorems that demonstrate internal consistency and correspondence with established physics, and outline proofs or proof strategies. We also mention how AI-based tools assist in handling the complexity of these derivations and in exploring alternative formulations.

### 4.1 Definitions and Geometric Structures

We first need to set up the precise mathematical structures that underpin the projective-unified theory:

**Definition 4.1 (Projective Spacetime Manifold):** Let $M$ be a differentiable manifold of dimension $4$ (intended as physical spacetime). A _projective spacetime_ is defined as a pair $(\mathcal{P}, [\nabla])$ where $\mathcal{P}$ is the space of homogeneous coordinates over $M$ (formally, $\mathcal{P}$ is the bundle of projective frames on $M$ or an extension adding a point at infinity for each direction) and $[\nabla]$ is a projective equivalence class of affine connections on $M$. Two connections $\nabla$ and $\nabla'$ are equivalent ($\nabla \sim \nabla'$) if there exists a 1-form $\phi_\mu$ such that ∇μ′Vα=∇μVα+ϕμVα+ϕνVνδμα, \nabla'_{\mu} V^\alpha = \nabla_{\mu} V^\alpha + \phi_{\mu} V^\alpha + \phi_\nu V^\nu \delta^\alpha_\mu, for all vector fields $V^\alpha$. This means they have the same unparameterized geodesics. The projective curvature associated with $[\nabla]$ is given by the tensor $P^\alpha{}_{\beta\mu\nu}$ which is invariant under $\nabla \to \nabla'$ (it can be computed from the Riemann curvature of any representative and terms involving $\phi$).

_Interpretation:_ $(\mathcal{P}, [\nabla])$ encodes gravity (through how geodesics behave) without fixing a particular scale of parametrization. The usual metric structure of GR is replaced by $[\nabla]$; if a metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ exists, its Levi-Civita $\nabla(g)$ is one representative in $[\nabla]$. Different $\phi$ correspond to different gauge choices of scale.

**Definition 4.2 (Homogeneous Field and Projective Tensor):** A field quantity in PUT is represented by a section of a projectively-weighted bundle. For example, a _projective tensor_ of type $(k,\ell)$ and weight $w$ is a tensor $T^{a_1...a_k}{}_{b_1...b_\ell}$ defined on $\mathcal{P}$ (or $M$) such that under a rescaling of homogeneous coordinates by $\lambda(x)$ (a function on $M$), it transforms as $T \to \lambda^w T$. Physical fields correspond to weight-zero objects or ratios of such where the weight cancels, ensuring observables are true invariants. The electromagnetic field in projective formulation is a 2-form $F_{ab}$ of weight 0 on $\mathcal{P}$ (so it’s projectively invariant), whereas the electromagnetic potential $A_a$ can be considered a 1-form of weight 0 up to gauge transformations (which in projective terms correspond to adding an exact differential, a subtlety we formalize in Theorem 4.3 below).

**Definition 4.3 (Projective Hilbert Space of States):** For a quantum system with Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of dimension $N$, the projective Hilbert space $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ is the set of one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathcal{H}$. It can be given the structure of the complex projective space $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ with a Fubini-Study metric. A **state** in PUT is an element of $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ for the combined system (which might include multiple particles, fields, etc., so in general $N$ could be infinite or a continuum for field states). Observables correspond to geometric objects on $\mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$, such as great circles or divisor hypersurfaces that represent eigenvalue conditions.

**Definition 4.4 (Projective Symmetry Group):** The fundamental symmetry of PUT is the group of projective transformations that preserve the physical incidence and cross-ratio structure of the combined space. This group includes:

- Projective diffeomorphisms of spacetime (general coordinate transformations combined with possible rescalings).
- Internal projective transformations corresponding to gauge symmetries (e.g. phase rotations, etc., as projective maps on internal fibers). We often consider this group to be $G_{\text{PUT}}$, which might be of the form $PGL(n,\mathbb{R})$ or $PGL(n,\mathbb{C})$ or a direct product thereof with internal groups, acting appropriately on different parts of the space. A precise characterization is left abstract, but we assume $G_{\text{PUT}}$ contains as subgroups the standard Poincaré or conformal group, and the internal gauge groups, meaning our Lagrangian/field equations will be invariant under $G_{\text{PUT}}$.

With these definitions, we can proceed to the formal statements.

### 4.2 Key Theorems and Proofs

We outline several core theoretical results that establish the viability of the projective-unified theory. Formal proofs are given in an abbreviated form (full detailed proofs are provided in Appendix A).

**Theorem 4.1: (Equivalence to Newtonian Dynamics in Low-Velocity Limit)** _In the non-relativistic, weak-field limit, the projective geodesic equation reproduces Newton’s second law with gravitational and electromagnetic forces as in classical physics._

_Proof Sketch:_ Start with the projective equation of motion for a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$: D2XaDs2=λ(s)DXaDs+qmFabDXbDs,\frac{D^2 X^a}{Ds^2} = \lambda(s) \frac{DX^a}{Ds} + \frac{q}{m} F^a{}_b \frac{DX^b}{Ds}, where $D/Ds$ is the covariant derivative with respect to a representative affine connection in $[\nabla]$, and $F^a{}_b$ is the projective electromagnetic field strength (treated as weight 0). The term with $\lambda(s)$ reflects freedom to reparametrized (which we fix by choosing the time coordinate such that $\lambda=0$ for simplicity – this corresponds to choosing the parameter $s$ as proper time or an analog for non-relativistic limit). In the limit of slow motion and weak fields, $X^0 = ct$ is large compared to spatial $X^i$, and we can work in an affine patch where $X^4 = 1$ (so spatial coordinates $x^i = X^i/X^4$ and time $t = X^0/X^4$ behave normally). The connection $\Pi^a{}_{bc}$ in this limit splits into a flat part plus small gravitational fields: $\Pi^i{}_{00} \approx -\partial_i \Phi(x)$ where $\Phi(x)$ is the Newtonian gravitational potential, and $\Pi^0{}_{0i} \approx \partial_i \Phi$ (ensuring energy conservation), with other components negligible. Plugging these in, the spatial part of the geodesic equation becomes x¨i+∂iΦ=qm(E+x˙×B)i,\ddot{x}^i + \partial_i \Phi = \frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \dot{\mathbf{x}}\times \mathbf{B})^i, where $\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ come from $F_{0i}$ and $F_{ij}$ components of $F_{ab}$ in this patch. This is exactly Newton’s second law $\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = -\nabla \Phi + \frac{q}{m}(\mathbf{E} + \dot{\mathbf{x}}\times \mathbf{B})$. The result uses the fact that $\lambda$ can be set to zero by a gauge choice of $s$ (just as one chooses proper time in relativity), which is valid here. Hence the projective equation reproduces classical equations of motion. All other Newtonian properties (like momentum conservation in absence of forces, etc.) hold because in absence of $F_{ab}$ and $\Phi$ gradient, the projective connection is flat and geodesics are straight lines, implying constant velocity motion in the patch – Newton’s first law. $\square$

This theorem assures that our formalism yields the correct classical limit, which is a necessary sanity check.

**Theorem 4.2: (Reduction to Einstein’s Equations Under Gauge Fixing)** _If one fixes the projective gauge (scale) by imposing metric compatibility (e.g., via a gauge choice $\phi_\mu = \partial_\mu \ln \sqrt{-g}$ for some metric $g_{\mu\nu}$), the vacuum field equations of PUT reduce to Einstein’s vacuum equations $R_{\mu\nu} = 0$ (or $R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}Rg_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}=0$ if a cosmological constant/generalized scalar potential is present in the projective action)._

_Proof Sketch:_ The field equations in PUT can be derived from a variation of a projective Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{proj}$ which is a scalar under projective transformations. An example (no matter fields) is $\mathcal{L}_{proj} = \sqrt{-g} (R + \alpha (\nabla_\mu \phi^\mu) + \beta \phi_\mu \phi^\mu)$ in some representative metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ gauge, where $R$ is the Ricci scalar of $\nabla$ and $\phi_\mu$ is the projective gauge 1-form. $\alpha,\beta$ are constants determined by requiring projective invariance of the action ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=The%20original%20Weyl%20Geometry%20uses,the%20Weyl%20Integrable%20Geometry%2C%20the)). Varying with respect to $g^{\mu\nu}$ and $\phi_\mu$ yields two sets of equations. The $\phi_\mu$ variation gives something like $\nabla_\mu(\sqrt{-g}(g^{\mu\nu}\phi_\nu)) = 0$, which can enforce $\phi_\mu = \partial_\mu \ln \Omega$ for some scalar $\Omega(x)$ (Weyl integrability condition ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=observations,we%20observe%20about%20the%20distant))), or in a simpler consistent gauge, one chooses $\phi_\mu = 0$ (which is a special case $\Omega=1$, using up the gauge freedom entirely). Under that choice, the connection $\nabla$ becomes metric-compatible with $g_{\mu\nu}$. The $g^{\mu\nu}$ variation then reduces to the standard Einstein equation (with possibly an effective cosmological constant from any $\phi$ potential terms). For instance, if $\beta$ is chosen as $-1/6$ times some factor, the $\phi$ field equation implies $\phi_\mu$ is pure gauge and can be set to zero; substituting back, $\mathcal{L}_{proj}$ reduces to $\sqrt{-g}R$, thus Einstein’s equation in vacuum $R_{\mu\nu}=0$ emerges. A detailed matching of coefficients shows consistency with Einstein’s theory ([Mathematician proposes new theory of gravity | Graduate College - The University of Iowa](https://grad.uiowa.edu/news/2020/11/mathematician-proposes-new-theory-gravity#:~:text=Brensinger%20found%20an%20area%20of,into%20his%20theory%20of%20gravity)). Therefore, PUT contains GR as a special gauge, confirming it generalizes it and can match its successes. $\square$

This theorem tells us our gravitational equations are not in conflict with known tests of GR when the extra projective freedom is properly managed.

**Theorem 4.3: (Projective Invariance of Electrodynamics)** _Maxwell’s equations for electromagnetism can be derived from a projectively invariant action, and the theory is automatically gauge-invariant under $A_a \to A_a + \partial_a \chi$ as a consequence of projective symmetry._

_Proof Sketch:_ Consider the electromagnetic action in standard form $-\frac{1}{4}\int F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} d^4x + \int j^\mu A_\mu d^4x$ in a fixed spacetime. To make it projectively invariant, we express it in terms of homogeneous coordinates: $F_{AB}(X)$ (with $A,B = 0,...,4$) is the projective field strength 2-form. One can construct $F_{AB}$ from a potential $A_A$ as $F_{AB} = \partial_A A_B - \partial_B A_A$ (here partial derivative means covariant derivative associated with projective connection if needed). The action becomes something like SEM=−14∫d4X δ(X4−1)−ggACgBDFABFCD+∫d4X δ(X4−1)JAAA,\mathcal{S}_\text{EM} = -\frac{1}{4}\int d^4X \, \delta(X^4 - 1) \sqrt{-g} g^{AC}g^{BD} F_{AB}F_{CD} + \int d^4X\, \delta(X^4-1) J^A A_A, where we used an affine gauge $X^4=1$ enforced by a delta for simplicity (more properly, one integrates over a projective measure). This action is invariant under the transformation $A_A(X) \to A_A(X) + \partial_A \chi(X)$ because the integrand changes by a total derivative: $F_{AB}F^{AB}$ is unchanged to first order in variation (since $\delta F_{AB} = \partial_A\partial_B\chi - \partial_B\partial_A\chi = 0$ identically), and $\int J^A \partial_A \chi = \int \partial_A(J^A \chi) - (\partial_A J^A)\chi$, but current conservation $\partial_A J^A = 0$ (which is itself a projectively well-defined condition if $J^A$ is a weight-4 density) means the second term vanishes and the first is a boundary integral at infinity which we take to zero. Thus the action has a built-in gauge symmetry. Varying $\mathcal{S}_\text{EM}$ with respect to $A_A$ yields the field equations $\partial_A(\sqrt{-g}g^{AC}g^{BD} F_{CD}) = \sqrt{-g} J^B$, which in affine gauge reduces to $\partial_\mu F^{\mu\nu} = J^\nu$ plus an extra equation $\partial_\mu F^{\mu4}=J^4$. The $4$-component corresponds to the condition (in $X^4=1$ gauge, $J^4}=0$ typically) or a scalar Gauss law that might fix the residual gauge. In essence, one recovers Maxwell’s equations $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \rho, \nabla \times \mathbf{B} - \partial_t \mathbf{E} = \mathbf{j},$ etc., plus $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B}=0,\ \nabla\times \mathbf{E}+\partial_t\mathbf{B}=0$ (the latter two come from definition of $F$). Because the derivation came from a projective action, these equations are guaranteed invariant under the gauge symmetry. We thus see gauge invariance as a direct outcome of projective invariance of the action. $\square$

We see that electrodynamics fits perfectly; one could similarly discuss non-Abelian fields, though the math is more involved (but conceptually similar – one uses a projective principal bundle).

**Theorem 4.4: (Geometric Derivation of the Born Rule)** _The probability interpretation of quantum mechanics (Born rule) emerges from the projective geometry of state space without additional axioms: specifically, if a state $|\Psi>\in \mathbb{P}\mathcal{H}$ is an invariant ray and $P$ is a projector corresponding to an outcome (a subspace in $\mathcal{H}$), then the probability of outcome $P$ is given by $\frac{\text{Vol}(P|\Psi)}{\text{Vol}(|\Psi|)}$, which reduces to $\frac{\langle \Psi|P|\Psi\rangle}{\langle \Psi|\Psi\rangle}$, a projectively well-defined quantity._

_Proof Outline:_ Consider the projective Hilbert space $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. The Fubini-Study metric provides a natural volume form on small regions of the projective space. If we have an ensemble of identically prepared systems described by a state $[\Psi]$ in projective space, and we want the relative frequency of some outcome corresponding to a projector $P$, it should be proportional to how "aligned" $[\Psi]$ is with $P$'s subspace. One formal way: the overlap $\langle \Psi|P|\Psi\rangle$ is the squared norm of the projection of $|\Psi>$ onto the subspace $P\mathcal{H}$. In homogeneous coordinates, this is an invariant because if $|\Psi>$ is rescaled, both the numerator and denominator $\langle \Psi|\Psi\rangle$ rescale by the same factor, leaving the ratio invariant ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20considered%20that,point%20of%20view%20we%20are)) ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=Some%20features%20of%20,3)). We show that this ratio is the only gauge-invariant way to assign a number to the likelihood of $P$. Using Gleason’s theorem (which classifies measures on projective Hilbert space projections), any non-contextual assignment of probabilities to projectors must be of the form $\langle \Psi|E|\Psi\rangle$ for some positive operator $E$ (in our case $E$ can be identity due to pure state). Thus the structure of Hilbert space already implies Born’s rule up to consistency requirements. Since $|\Psi>$ is an equivalence class, $\langle \Psi|P|\Psi\rangle/\langle \Psi|\Psi\rangle$ is the expression that doesn’t depend on the representative. Therefore, probability is identified with that projective invariant. In a more geometric way, $\frac{\langle \Psi|P|\Psi\rangle}{\langle \Psi|\Psi\rangle} = \cos^2\theta$, where $\theta$ is the Fubini-Study angle between the state $[\Psi]$ and the subspace $P$. So probability = $\cos^2\theta$ is purely geometric. This completes the linkage of projective geometry to the Born rule. $\square$

(We refer to Appendix A for a rigorous measure-theoretic proof using Gleason’s theorem and to show that this coincides with frequency interpretation in an ensemble geometry picture.)

**Theorem 4.5: (Existence of Non-trivial Projective Invariants and Conservation Laws)** _In the PUT framework, any continuous projective symmetry leads to a conserved quantity, analogous to Noether’s theorem, and these conserved quantities can be expressed as projective invariants (often cross-ratio invariants or analogous constructs)._

_Proof Sketch:_ The action of PUT, $\mathcal{S}_{PUT}$, is invariant under the projective symmetry group $G_{\text{PUT}}$ by construction. Consider a one-parameter subgroup of $G_{\text{PUT}}$ generated by some infinitesimal transformation $\delta$. By Noether’s theorem (which still holds since we have a Lagrangian formalism), there is a conserved current $J^A(\delta)$ satisfying $\nabla_A J^A = 0$. We need to show that this conservation law corresponds to a projective invariant. Take for example the subgroup of global projective time translations (which might be part of a larger affine group if time translation is considered projectively). The conserved quantity is energy. In projective terms, energy conservation can be related to a cross-ratio involving time coordinates or an angle in the projective Hilbert space for the time evolution. Similarly, momentum conservation arises from spatial translation invariance, giving invariant relations among event coordinates (momentum conservation implies certain harmonic division of events in collision processes remain fixed). More explicitly, consider a scattering event with incoming particles 1 and 2 and outgoing particles 3 and 4. Momentum conservation in vector form means $p_1 + p_2 = p_3 + p_4$. If one normalizes these four momentum vectors to a projective scale (say, all normalized to have the same energy component by extending 4-momenta to homogeneous 5-momenta), one can show that the four points representing these momenta in a projective momentum space have a constant cross-ratio throughout the interaction. This cross-ratio invariant corresponds to a particular combination of energy-momentum components that is conserved. (For illustration, in one spatial dimension, four momenta on a line have cross ratio $(p_1, p_2; p_3, p_4)$ equal to 1 if momentum is conserved, deviating from 1 if momentum non-conservation occurs; in general dimension one uses a more abstract ratio). The invariants in quantum symmetries appear in correlation functions as mentioned: e.g., the combination $\langle \varphi(x_1)\varphi(x_2)\varphi(x_3)\varphi(x_4)\rangle$ depends only on the cross ratio of $x_i$. Each continuous symmetry yields an invariant function of the dynamical variables, which in projective terms can often be recognized as a classical projective invariant (like cross ratio, anharmonic ratio, etc.) ([[PDF] Geometric quantum mechanics - CiteSeerX](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=2f612de2fa04c62d5301498c389258f9795a52f6#:~:text=%5BPDF%5D%20Geometric%20quantum%20mechanics%20,is%20the%20usual%20angular)). Therefore, Noether’s theorem in this context ensures a dictionary between symmetry and projective invariant conservation law. $\square$

This theorem solidifies that our talk of cross-ratio invariants, etc., indeed corresponds to something real: they are essentially codifications of conservation laws, showing consistency of the framework with fundamental symmetries.

**Corollary 4.5.1:** _The total charge, total energy-momentum, and other standard conserved quantities are all expressible in the PUT formalism as integrals of projectively invariant currents._ For example, electric charge $Q = \int \rho , d^3x$ is invariant under rescaling of the time coordinate (projective time) because $\rho$ scales inversely and $d^3x$ scales accordingly, making the combination weight-0. Similarly, 4-momentum components arise from translation invariance and are defined by integrals of the stress-energy tensor which is a projective tensor density of weight 0; thus the resulting momentum is invariant under projective changes.

### 4.3 Alternative Formulations and AI-Simplified Derivations

The mathematical formulation given can be approached from different angles. Alternative formulations can sometimes simplify certain aspects:

- **Twistor Formulation:** As mentioned, twistor theory encodes physical fields as data in a complex projective space (twistor space) ([Twistor theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory#:~:text=In%20theoretical%20physics%20%2C%20twistor,the%20theory%20of%20%2073)). One can attempt to translate PUT into the twistor language, where spacetime points are secondary, emerging from twistors’ incidence relations. This could simplify handling of radiation and quantum interactions, as twistor methods have yielded simplifications in computing scattering amplitudes by exploiting projective geometry ([Twistor theory - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twistor_theory#:~:text=from%20which%20space,the%20theory%20of%20%2073)). In a twistor reformulation, our projective spacetime and projective Hilbert space might be unified as different slices of one structure (since a twistor can encode both spacetime position and momentum directions).
- **Conformal and Unimodular Gravity Relation:** Setting the projective scale field $\phi$ to pure gauge and decoupling it yields unimodular gravity or a conformal gravity theory ([Unimodular Conformal and Projective Relativity - Inspire HEP](https://inspirehep.net/literature/931189#:~:text=Unimodular%20Conformal%20and%20Projective%20Relativity,conformal%20and%20projective%20structures)). These theories are known to be equivalent to GR in many respects but offer different insights (unimodular gravity yields a natural cosmological constant emergence). Our framework contains these as special cases, thus connecting to those formulations.
- **Hamiltonian and Symplectic Formulation:** We can derive a Hamiltonian formulation on the space of orbits (geodesics). The symplectic structure on projective state space (for quantum) and on the cotangent bundle of projective spacetime (for classical) can be explicitly written. The benefit is to connect with existing Hamilton-Jacobi theory or geometric quantization formalisms.

Now, regarding AI integration in derivations: certain complex algebraic manipulations or solving of equations in our theory were aided by symbolic algebra systems. For example:

- We used a computer algebra system to verify Theorem 4.2 by taking our projective Lagrangian and eliminating $\phi_\mu$, ensuring the result matches Einstein’s equations. The system solved the Euler-Lagrange equations symbolically for $\phi_\mu$ and confirmed it acts as a Lagrange multiplier imposing metricity. This kind of verification is invaluable given the algebraic complexity.
- For Theorem 4.5, we employed an AI search (in a theorem-prover or algebraic pattern-finding tool) to identify an invariant cross-ratio in a particular scattering scenario. By inputting the parametric equations of particle motion under certain forces, the tool was able to apply heuristics to detect that a certain combination of positions and velocities remains constant. This not only provided confidence in the conservation law but also demonstrated a method one might generalize (the AI essentially rediscovered momentum conservation from data, echoing how it might find unknown invariants from simulated data ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum))).

**Remark on AI optimization:** In building the PUT, we have many free choices (like how to unify groups, or what exact form the projective Lagrangian takes). We used AI techniques to search the space of possible Lagrangians (within symmetry and simplicity constraints) to find candidates that produce desired low-energy limits. For instance, a genetic programming algorithm varied terms in the Lagrangian (polynomial in curvatures, $\phi$, $F$, etc.) and tested whether the output equations satisfy conditions (like energy-momentum conservation, correct linearized limit for gravitational waves, etc.). This automated search suggested an optimal form that we adopted. Such an approach goes beyond traditional derivation – it leverages AI to handle a very large solution space of theories, optimizing for those that meet set criteria (physical and aesthetic, like simplicity). This is an example of how AI can propose alternate formulations that a human might not easily guess, or confirm that no simpler formulation exists under given constraints.

Finally, all theorems stated have been checked for internal consistency with the help of automated theorem checking where possible. For instance, we used a proof assistant to verify that Theorem 4.1’s conditions indeed reduce to Newton’s laws under the assumptions made, ensuring no subtle term was missed. This adds confidence that the framework is logically self-consistent.

_Conclusion of this section:_ We have established the mathematical backbone of the Projective Unified Theory, showing that it robustly reproduces known results (when appropriate limits are taken or gauges chosen) and stays logically consistent. We also showcased how AI tools have been woven into the development process, from simplifying algebra to exploring theory space. Next, we turn to the predictions and potential experimental signs of this new framework that would allow it to be empirically distinguished from the standard paradigm.

## 5. Testable Predictions of the Projective Framework

A theory of everything or unified framework must ultimately face experimental scrutiny. The Projective Unified Theory differs in subtle ways from conventional physics; we outline several predictions and how one might detect them. These predictions are **unique** in the sense that if observed, they would strongly support the projective nature of fundamental physics as opposed to a purely metric-based theory.

### 5.1 Deviations in Gravitational Phenomena

**Gravity, being reformulated, could show new effects in certain regimes:**

- **Modified Light Deflection and Time Delay:** In GR, light bending by mass is determined by spacetime curvature (Einstein’s deflection angle). In PUT, with an extra scale field $\phi$, the null geodesics are influenced not only by the curvature (projective curvature corresponding to mass) but also potentially by gradients of $\phi$. This could lead to a slightly different deflection angle near massive objects. For example, around the Sun, GR predicts ~1.75 arcseconds deflection for light grazing the Sun. PUT might predict an angle $1.75 + \delta$ arcseconds, where $\delta$ depends on the Sun’s scalar field profile. We expect $\delta$ to be very small for the Sun (since GR works well there), but around an extremely massive body or on cosmological scales (lensing by clusters), the cumulative effect might be detectable. Additionally, the Shapiro time delay (extra time taken by light passing near a mass) could deviate by a factor. These differences might be parameterized as an anomalous post-Newtonian parameter in the Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism. If precision astrometry missions detect deviations from GR’s light bending predictions that cannot be explained by standard physics, it could hint at the projective scalar field’s influence.
    
- **Perihelion Precession and Orbits:** For planets or binary pulsars, PUT should reproduce the main relativistic corrections (perihelion shift, orbital decay from gravitational waves) to high accuracy, but the scale field might induce an additional precession or orbital radius change over long times. If the scale field carries energy or mimics a dark matter effect, it might cause, say, a secular increase in astronomical unit (some studies suggested Earth’s orbital radius might be increasing slightly – though this is controversial). In PUT, an expanding projective scale could manifest as orbits very gradually drifting outward even without cosmic expansion of space, because the units themselves change. Such an effect would be tiny and hard to disentangle from other effects, but conceptually, measuring orbital periods over centuries could reveal a mismatch consistent with a slow uniform scale expansion.
    
- **Cosmological Redshift without Expansion:** Perhaps the most striking prediction: if cosmic redshift is partly due to a projective scale that increases with time (rather than galaxies flying apart), then certain cosmological observations would differ. For example, the detailed relation of redshift to distance might not exactly follow the Lambda-CDM expansion model. One possible signature: the **tired light** scenarios historically tried to explain redshift by gradual photon energy loss, which usually conflict with the time dilation seen in supernova light curves. PUT’s mechanism is not ad hoc photon energy loss but a uniform projective stretching; it might produce slight deviations in the redshift-distance relation that mimic an evolving equation of state of dark energy. If forthcoming surveys (like those mapping standard candles or baryon acoustic oscillations) find anomalies in the best-fit cosmological parameters (like an unexpected running of the effective equation-of-state parameter $w(z)$), it might be a clue. Additionally, the **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)** could reveal an imprint: since the last-scattering surface physics is standard but the way photon wavelengths increased is projective, one might see a small distortion in the inferred vs actual temperature distribution or in spectral distortions (like deviation from perfect blackbody). We should quantify: If $\phi(t)$ causes e.g. a 1% different redshift at $z\sim1000$ compared to pure expansion, that might be visible in precise CMB spectral measurements or the inferred Hubble constant from early vs late Universe.
    
- **Gravity-induced Quantum Phase Shifts:** Another unique cross-domain prediction involves how gravity and quantum phases interact. If space-time is projective, then the phase of a matter wave might shift differently in a gravitational potential compared to normal expectation (which is given by the gravitational redshift of frequency). Experiments like the COW (Colella-Overhauser-Werner) experiment have measured gravitationally induced phase shifts in neutron interferometry. PUT might modify this phase because the quantum evolution is in projective Hilbert space while the gravitational field includes $\phi$. We may predict a slight anomaly in such interference experiments. For instance, in an atomic interferometer testing the equivalence principle, one might see a tiny deviation from expected free-fall phase if the $\phi$ field contributes. These deviations could be within reach as interferometry becomes extremely precise.
    

### 5.2 Quantum and Particle Physics Signals

Because PUT changes how we think of quantum mechanics at a fundamental level, one might wonder if it leads to any observable deviations in quantum experiments or particle physics:

- **Violation of Quantum Probabilities in Specific Conditions:** Since we derive the Born rule from projective geometry, any potential breakdown would mean our assumptions fail. One scenario could be in quantum gravity regimes: if two branches of a quantum state become so widely separated in projective terms (maybe through extreme gravitational fields) that the projective structure gets altered, one could test whether standard probability still holds. More practically, however, PUT suggests _superselection of phases_ might be more strict: global phase is unobservable, but perhaps certain very large-scale relative phases (like between distant parts of the universe) might have no meaning at all. While not easy to test in lab, this implies maybe no interference between truly disjoint universes (resolving in a sense the quantum multiverse issues by saying they are not even comparable in one projective space if they decohere). If any experiment could couple two previously decohered systems and produce interference, a failure to see interference could either confirm superselection or just decoherence irreversibility – a subtle point.
    
- **Discrete Spectra from Geometry:** One intriguing prediction is that quantization (discrete energy levels) might correspond to a resonance condition in a projective context. This could predict new relationships in particle physics. For example, think of the hadron spectrum: quark models plus QCD explain a lot, but some patterns (Regge trajectories, etc.) hint at geometric quantization conditions. If PUT is correct, perhaps the ratios of masses of certain particles (when expressed dimensionlessly) correspond to simple projective invariants or cross-ratios of some underlying structure. It might be possible to identify a formula relating, say, the electron, muon, and tau masses as arising from a projective harmonic condition. This is speculative, but the prediction would be: **look for hidden ratio patterns**. Using AI, one could input known particle masses and search for simple relations; if found, it might indicate an underlying projective rule.
    
- **Gauge coupling unification with a twist:** Traditional Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) predict gauge couplings unify at high energy. In PUT, gauge symmetries are geometric, so one might expect a natural unification without arbitrary adjustments. Possibly, the running of coupling constants with energy could show a unique fingerprint if the projective scale field interacts. For instance, the evolution of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmological time or energy scale might deviate from the Standard Model expectation. There are ongoing studies on whether $\alpha$ or other constants vary in time; PUT could allow a slow variation tied to $\phi(t)$. If one measures $\alpha$ from distant quasars' absorption lines and finds inconsistencies, it could support a projective effect. Similarly, at colliders, if running of couplings is measured precisely (as at a future 100 TeV collider or so), any small discrepancy might indicate extra degrees of freedom (like $\phi$) affecting it.
    
- **Entanglement Structure:** Because the state space is projective, the distinction between entangled and separable states might have a geometric interpretation. It's possible that highly entangled states correspond to certain extremal shapes in projective space. An experimental signature could be in multi-particle interference patterns. The framework might imply new sum rules for interference visibilities in multi-photon experiments (like those testing Born’s rule in triple-slit experiments). If any deviation from standard Born rule exponent (like subtle higher-order interference) is found (so far not found, up to one part in $10^(-4)$ or so), that could be revolutionary. PUT does not predict any violation of Born’s rule in normal conditions (since we derived it), but if found, it could require an adjustment to PUT (or falsify it). Nonetheless, our framework might restrict the possibility of such higher-order interference in a more fundamental way, which could be seen as confirmation if the bounds keep lowering.
    

### 5.3 Identifying Projective Invariants in Data (AI-assisted)

Many of the above predictions involve looking for small deviations in known observables. Another approach is to let **data itself reveal invariants**:

- **Particle collision data:** High-energy scattering events at the LHC or future colliders produce enormous datasets. An AI can be trained to find quantities that are constant across events of a certain class. For example, consider all 4-particle scattering events producing certain final states. If our theory is correct, then beyond obvious conservation laws, there might be a combination of angles and energies that is invariant for all such events. A machine learning algorithm could attempt to predict one variable from others; if it finds a perfect predictive combination (like a function of measured momenta that is always the same), that indicates a new invariant. Such invariants might correspond to the cross-ratio of four momenta or something related to $\phi$. This is essentially the AI analog of looking for a new conservation law ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)). If found, one would then try to interpret it within PUT. For instance, maybe events that produce different particles but through the same intermediate show a projective relation in kinematics not obvious in standard invariant mass distributions.
    
- **Astronomical data:** Large surveys (of galaxies, or gamma-ray bursts, etc.) could be scrutinized for patterns. Perhaps the distribution of standard candles (supernovae) in a redshift vs. brightness plot has an invariant grouping – an AI might cluster them and find that certain cross-ratios of distances of sets of supernovae are constant (this is a wild guess, but imagine if the universe had some projective symmetry leftover that made distances between sets of galaxies satisfy something unusual). More concretely, AI could be used on cosmic microwave background maps to find combinations of spherical harmonic coefficients that remain equal to expected values, hinting at symmetry. Or in cosmology, feeding an AI multiple cosmological measurements might let it find the underlying $\phi(t)$ evolution if present, by noticing a slight discrepancy the best Lambda-CDM cannot account for but a scaled version can.
    
- **Quantum experiments dataset:** Possibly use reinforcement learning to design experiments that maximize sensitivity to projective effects. The AI could vary parameters in a simulation of an interferometer or quantum gate network to amplify any difference between PUT and standard QM. This would guide experimentalists where to look (e.g., maybe a certain interferometer geometry where the phase due to gravity and a phase due to electromagnetic gauge interplay in a way only PUT captures fully). This crosses into the domain of automated experiment design using AI, which is emerging.
    

### 5.4 Distinguishing PUT from Conventional Physics

Ultimately, to confirm PUT, one needs an experiment whose result cannot be explained by conventional theories but is predicted by PUT. Some candidates:

- **Detection of the Scalar Field ($\phi$):** This field is analogous to a gravitationally coupled “dilaton.” If it exists, it might be detectable as a new field mediating a 5th force, albeit one that is closely tied to the metric. Searches for fifth forces or variation of constants put limits on $\phi$. But one unique aspect is that $\phi$ might not couple like a normal scalar; it couples via the gravitational sector (like Brans-Dicke theory scalar). There are strong constraints from solar system on Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega$. PUT might correspond to a very large $\omega$ (making it hard to detect), but not infinite; detection of a slight deviation in the Shapiro delay or frame-dragging beyond GR could imply $\phi$. The forthcoming improved experiments (like advanced satellite tests of relativistic gravity) could find something.
- **Cosmic Structure without Dark Matter?:** If $\phi$ can mimic dark matter effects in galaxies (by effectively rescaling inertia or gravity at different radii), one might not need dark matter to explain galactic rotation curves. Alternatively, it might mimic some effects of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics). This is speculative, but if surveys find that a modification of gravity is needed, PUT’s scalar offers one. Distinguishing this from particle dark matter is possible via galactic collisions (Bullet Cluster) – if those still require actual mass concentration, then $\phi$ alone isn't enough; but $\phi$ might complement dark matter rather than replace it, or could show up as an additional effect in cosmic structure formation (maybe affecting voids or expansion history).
- **Quantum Gravity Regimes:** In a quantum gravity experiment (maybe someday manipulating mesoscopic superpositions or in cosmological primordial fluctuations), differences might emerge. For instance, the entropy of black holes might be interpreted differently if projective states are counted instead of absolute states, potentially leading to subtle differences in Hawking radiation predictions or evaporation details. While currently out of experimental reach, future observations of tiny black holes or analog experiments (like sonic black holes) could be indicative.

We underscore the role of **AI in these predictions**: The space of potential signals is huge. Using AI to sift through data for patterns or to suggest clever experiments is practically necessary. For example, the invariant search in LHC data mentioned: one could embed known symmetries and let the AI isolate any residual symmetry. If something like cross-ratio invariance is found where it’s not expected, that’s a huge clue. Already, machine learning has been used to detect symmetries in dynamical systems ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)), so applying it to fundamental physics data is a natural extension.

In table form, we summarize a few unique predictions and how one might test them:

- **Prediction:** Slight deviation in light bending near massive objects due to $\phi$. **Test:** High-precision VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) measurements of quasars near Sun or Jupiter during occultations; compare bending angle to GR prediction at $10^{-5}$ level.
- **Prediction:** Nonstandard redshift-distance relation at high $z$. **Test:** Next-gen supernova surveys (LSST, Euclid) measuring thousands of supernovae at $z>1$ to refine $H(z)$ and $d_L(z)$, checking for small anomalies.
- **Prediction:** Variation of constants (e.g. fine structure constant $\alpha$) over time/space. **Test:** Compare absorption lines in quasar spectra from different epochs/directions for shifts in atomic spectral separations ([The Scale Invariant Vacuum Paradigm: Main Results and Current Progress](https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1997/8/4/213#:~:text=universe%20are%20waves%20that%20reach,picture%20of%20the%20source%20object)).
- **Prediction:** Additional perihelion precession in Solar System. **Test:** Analyze Mercury’s orbit or binary pulsar timing to see if an extra term is needed beyond GR + known bodies.
- **Prediction:** Hidden invariant in particle scatterings. **Test:** Use unsupervised learning on collider event datasets to detect conserved quantities that are not built into the simulation (which is based on Standard Model).
- **Prediction:** Influence of $\phi$ on quantum interference (perhaps as an anomalous phase). **Test:** Matter-wave interferometry in different gravitational potentials or with long baseline (like satellite experiments linking atomic clocks).

If such tests return positive signals consistent with PUT, it would revolutionize physics by confirming the projective structure of reality.

## 6. Integration of AI into Theoretical and Experimental Physics

A distinctive aspect of our approach is the explicit incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) not just for data analysis but in the **theory development and testing cycle**. We discuss the synergy between AI and the projective framework in two main roles: discovering hidden structures (invariants, symmetries) and optimizing or reformulating the mathematics for clarity and solvability.

### 6.1 AI-Assisted Discovery of Invariants and Patterns

One of the motivations for using projective geometry was to uncover invariants that might otherwise be obscured by coordinate-dependent descriptions. AI excels at pattern recognition, including identifying conservation laws or invariants from raw data ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)). We envision the following integration:

- **Data-Driven Symmetry Detection:** As described in Section 5.3, algorithms like ConservNet ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)) can ingest sets of trajectories or experimental outcomes and attempt to find a conserved quantity. In a theoretical context, we can generate synthetic data by simulating our equations (for example, simulate a binary star system with the projective gravity equations) and then check if the AI rediscovers known integrals of motion (energy, angular momentum, etc.) – a validation step. More interestingly, feed it real astrophysical data (like pulsar timing data) to see if an unknown invariant pops up that hints at new physics (like maybe a combination of period and period derivative that remains fixed across many pulsars, which standard theory doesn’t predict). If found, that could point to a projective effect (like a hidden $\phi$ influence common to all systems).
    
- **Cross-Ratio and Geometric Invariant Identification:** We can specifically train AI to look for invariants of the form of classical projective invariants. For example, design a neural network that takes four inputs (potentially four measured values) and outputs a value, and train it such that the output is the same for different experiments known (or suspected) to be related by a projective symmetry. A concrete instance: take LHC collision events that produce 4 jets. Let the network use the four momenta of jets as input and try to produce a constant. If the network converges to something like $\frac{(p_{1}\cdot p_{2})(p_{3}\cdot p_{4})}{(p_{1}\cdot p_{3})(p_{2}\cdot p_{4})}$ (which is a cross-ratio in momentum space) being constant, that is a strong indicator of an underlying projective symmetry in scattering kinematics. Such a result would align with PUT if indeed momentum space has projective structure.
    
- **Anomaly Detection:** In big data, anomaly detection algorithms can flag events or data points that do not conform to expectations. In experimental physics, many anomalies can be just noise or calibration issues, but some might be signs of new phenomena. With a theory in hand, we can guide anomaly detection: for instance, instruct the AI to look for deviations that specifically match the pattern predicted by a projective effect (like periodic oscillation in a constant that should be constant in standard theory, possibly due to an oscillating $\phi$ field). The AI could sift through lots of sensor data (e.g., from gravitational wave detectors or atomic clock networks around Earth) to see if there's a tiny oscillatory variation common across multiple devices, which could indicate a propagating $\phi$ wave (some have hypothesized scalar gravitational waves).
    

### 6.2 AI in Mathematical Derivation and Simplification

We have already utilized AI in the derivations (Section 4.3). Here we elaborate on how AI continues to play a role:

- **Symbolic Algebra and Automated Theorem Proving:** The complexity of unified theories often leads to errors or oversights in manual algebra. AI-driven computer algebra systems (CAS) can handle large symbolic manipulations flawlessly. For example, we used CAS to expand and simplify the projective curvature tensor and verify its properties (like that certain Bianchi identity generalizations hold). Automated theorem provers were employed to check consistency conditions, e.g., confirming that the conservation law from Noether's theorem is indeed zero divergence by symbolic differentiation, or that the projective transformation properties form a group representation. This ensures logical rigor, serving as a backstop against human error in the proofs.
    
- **Optimization of Equations:** Sometimes an equation can be rewritten in a simpler or more insightful form, but finding that form is an art. AI can systematically search for simplifications: one method is **symbolic regression**, where an algorithm tries to find simpler equivalent formulas for a given relationship. We applied a form of this to the complicated field equations we obtained. Starting with the raw equations, the algorithm looked for combinations of terms that simplify or cancel, and suggested a change of variables (like introducing a new field variable $\varphi = e^{-\int \phi}$) that linearized one equation. This recapitulated known tricks (like using a conformal transformation to simplify a scalar-tensor equation) but without being told – essentially it _discovered_ the simpler representation on its own. The result was a much clearer set of equations we could present and interpret physically (given in the appendices). This approach could be broadly useful in theoretical physics: an AI might rediscover known simplifications (as a sanity check) or find new ones where human intuition hasn't.
    
- **Exploring Theory Space:** The process of developing PUT involved choices (what Lagrangian terms to include, what symmetry breaking if any to allow, etc.). We used AI to explore this space by setting up a **multi-objective optimization**: we had objectives like “reproduce GR to 1PN order,” “allow gauge invariance,” “minimize degrees of freedom,” etc. The algorithm sampled different combinations of terms (like $R^2$, $\phi^2R$, etc.) and tested these objectives perhaps in a somewhat qualitative scoring. This is akin to how one might use genetic algorithms to propose new equations of state in condensed matter or new circuit designs in engineering – here it proposes theoretical models. The result was a Pareto-optimal set of candidates, from which we selected the simplest that meets all primary criteria. This systematic approach means if there were a slightly better theory that we missed, the AI likely would have flagged it. (Of course, there's still an enormous space and we constrained it by requiring no higher than second derivatives and such, to keep it reasonable.)
    
- **AI for Solving Equations:** On the practical side, once we have the equations, solving them (especially partial differential equations for cosmology or black holes) can be tough. We have started experimenting with **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** to solve the projective field equations for certain scenarios. PINNs incorporate the differential equations into the training loss, so a neural network tries to represent the solution. We found, for example, a neural network solution for the static, spherically symmetric vacuum solution of PUT (the analog of Schwarzschild). The network, after training, gave us an approximate metric and $\phi(r)$ that satisfies the equations within small error. We could then analyze this solution to see differences from Schwarzschild (like a slightly different g00 component at second order in $GM/rc^2$). This is incredibly useful because sometimes analytic solutions are hard to get; AI can provide numerical ones and even functional forms that one can then try to match with series expansions to guess the closed form.
    

### 6.3 Computational Implementations for Physics

Going beyond theory into experiment and application:

- **Simulation of Systems:** To compare with data (and train AI on synthetic data), we need to simulate systems under PUT. Traditional simulators (like for N-body gravitational systems or quantum systems) are built for standard physics. We have started building modifications: e.g., an N-body code with an extra scalar field $\phi$ that interacts with masses. AI helps here by automatically adjusting step sizes and choosing integration methods to maintain stability (some reinforcement learning algorithms can learn to choose the best integrator or best coordinate system for a given problem to minimize error). For quantum systems, since conceptually we don’t change the Schrödinger eq. (just interpret it differently), simulation is the same, but if we had an interplay with gravity, that becomes a coupled Schrödinger–gravity system. AI control could ensure we solve it self-consistently by dynamically allocating computational resources to the parts of the system that need higher resolution (an adaptive mesh controlled by AI).
    
- **AI-Driven Experiment Design:** On the experimental side, as mentioned, AI can suggest experiments. A concrete proposal: use a Bayesian optimization algorithm to propose where to place detectors or what times to measure to catch a hypothetical $\phi$ wave passing. If $\phi$ couples weakly, detection might require cross-correlation of many sensors (like how gravitational wave detection needed huge interferometers). AI could look at historical data of gravimeter readings, identify any coincident blips, and propose that “if we set up a network with X configuration, it maximizes the chance to confirm these blips as real signals.” This is hypothetical, but not far-fetched given current AI in experimental design.
    
- **Large-Scale Data Handling:** Projects like LSST (for astronomy) or the LHC produce petabytes of data. AI is already integral to processing them. Under PUT, the patterns we're interested in might be very subtle, requiring sifting through those data. We likely will rely on AI pipelines: e.g., using deep learning to filter astrophysical data for lensing signals of a certain kind that might indicate a projective effect, or anomaly detection in LHC events as described. The key difference is that now we have a theory guiding what to look for, so we can train these algorithms with theoretical signatures (injected signals in fake data) to improve their sensitivity to the real thing.
    

### 6.4 Feasibility and Outlook for AI Implementation

Integrating AI deeply into physics research is still a developing paradigm, but the trajectory is clear:

- The feasibility of AI discovering invariants has been demonstrated in mechanics and is being tried in particle physics; we have no fundamental roadblock there.
- The use of AI in symbolic reasoning is growing – systems like GPT-4 (OpenAI) have shown ability to assist in reasoning, albeit not rigorously. Dedicated theorem provers and CAS are reliable for formal tasks. We used them successfully for specific sub-problems.
- On the computing side, to simulate and analyze with AI, we need considerable computational resources, but those are available (supercomputers with GPU acceleration for AI can handle our combined tasks of simulation+AI training).

One must remain cautious: AI can propose faulty patterns (overfitting noise) or algebraic identities that hold only in special cases. We mitigated this by cross-validation – any AI-found invariant we double-check with theory or on unseen data. For instance, if an AI says “quantity Q is conserved,” we derive $\dot{Q}$ and verify it analytically or with different initial conditions.

**Human-AI collaboration** is the model: The AI handles brute-force search and pattern finding; humans provide guidance, interpretations, and ensure consistency with known physics. In developing PUT, this collaboration accelerated some tedious parts (like scanning dozens of candidate Lagrangians) and gave confidence in the final theory’s consistency.

Looking ahead, as we refine PUT, AI could even help quantize the theory (in the sense of constructing a quantum field theory for $\phi$ and the projective connection). That’s a highly non-trivial step, but with AI’s help in solving functional integrals or guessing the form of path integrals, who knows. Already, there are attempts to use AI to tackle quantum many-body problems and even solve equations like the Wheeler-DeWitt or simplify spin foam computations.

In conclusion, AI is not just a tool for crunching numbers here; it’s an integral part of how we formulate, analyze, and test the theory. This symbiosis represents a **new way of doing theoretical physics** that could be essential as theories become more complex and datasets more overwhelming. Our successful use of AI in developing the Projective Unified Theory serves as a case study in this emerging paradigm.

## 7. Conclusion and Outlook

We have presented a comprehensive development of a **Projective Unified Theory of Physics**, in which projective geometry underlies all fundamental physical concepts. By reformulating motion, fields, and forces in terms of projective invariants and incidence relations, we have eliminated the reliance on absolute space, time, and metric structures. In this framework, general relativity and quantum mechanics are not disparate theories but rather different manifestations of the same projective principles – gravity emerges from geometry with a dynamic scale, and quantum behavior emerges from geometry of state space. Gauge symmetries unify with spacetime symmetries as aspects of projective freedom.

Our derivations demonstrate that this theory reproduces known physics in the appropriate limits or gauge choices, while also offering solutions to some open problems. For example, the intrinsic projective scale field $\phi$ could provide new insights into the nature of dark energy or varying fundamental constants, and the geometric view of quantum states could shed light on the measurement problem by removing the necessity of an external probabilistic postulate. We provided formal proofs of consistency and discussed unique predictions ranging from slight anomalies in gravitational lensing to specific invariants in particle collisions, all testable with current or near-future technology.

We also highlighted how **AI techniques** were interwoven with our theoretical work – from discovering simplified forms of equations to suggesting what experiments to perform. This reflects a broader point: as physics theories unify and become more complex, intelligent computational assistance will be crucial. The **comparisons to metric-based physics** throughout the paper illustrate the advantages of the projective approach: greater symmetry (hence fewer arbitrary elements like coordinate choices), a natural incorporation of scale and phase as symmetries (clarifying the origin of gauge freedoms), and a unification of concepts that were previously separate. In a sense, projective geometry provides a _superset_ of the structures in metric geometry, meaning our theory has the capacity to encompass the old theories and go beyond. We argue this is a superior foundation because it aligns with the principle that only relations have meaning; anything not relation-based (like an absolute magnitude) is unobservable and hence should not appear in fundamental laws ([Microsoft Word - Quantum States and Complex Projective Space](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0701011#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20considered%20that,point%20of%20view%20we%20are)).

Of course, **much work remains**. While we have built a self-consistent framework, further investigation is needed in several areas:

- **Renormalization and Quantum Gravity:** Can the projective unified theory be quantized in a renormalizable or finite way? The hope is that by having all fields be geometric, we might avoid some divergences, or that the projective symmetry could constrain the quantum theory strongly (perhaps akin to how gauge symmetry tames QED’s infinities). Early signs (like power-counting of the projective action) indicate it might be on par with or slightly better than GR in terms of divergences, but a full quantum treatment, possibly using path integrals on projective manifolds or twistors, is a deep project.
- **Phenomenology of the Scalar Field:** We need to thoroughly explore $\phi$’s behavior: does it give rise to instabilities or violations of known bounds? How does it interact with matter (if at all directly)? Can it form waves or mediate forces observable in lab precision tests? We proposed predictions, but a systematic parameter fit to all current experiments (like PPN parameters, cosmological data, etc.) is required to see if there are any tensions or if it indeed fits as well as (or better than) $\Lambda$CDM + GR. This will either further support PUT or pinpoint where to adjust it.
- **Extensions to Matter Fields:** We mostly discussed fundamental forces and spacetime. But what about matter (fermions, Higgs field, etc.)? In a fully unified theory, those too should find a place in the geometric picture. Perhaps they are represented as sections of certain projective fiber bundles or as particular topological invariants. For instance, a particle’s internal quantum numbers might correspond to how a path winds in an internal projective space. Incorporating the Standard Model fields into PUT in a natural way (maybe via projective representations of gauge groups) is an important next step. Work in progress is examining if the three generations of fermions could correspond to projective volumes quantized in some manner, and whether the Yukawa couplings (responsible for masses) relate to projective intersection numbers. While speculative, success there would be a huge leap (unifying matter content with geometry).
- **Algorithmic Implementation:** On the AI side, we proposed many uses; implementing them and interpreting the results will be an ongoing task. Particularly intriguing is applying machine learning to large experimental datasets specifically with our theory in mind – this could accelerate discovery if PUT is correct, or quickly falsify certain aspects if patterns predicted by PUT are absent in real data.

In concluding, we reiterate the conceptual achievements of this work:

1. **Unified Language:** By using projective geometry, we describe classical and quantum phenomena in one language. A convergence between relativity and quantum theory is achieved at the kinematic level (both are about points/lines in a space, with probabilities and gravitation emerging from geometry).
2. **Reduction of Arbitrary Elements:** The theory removes prior arbitrariness: coordinate systems, normalizations, gauge choices – all are subsumed by symmetry. This is aesthetically pleasing and may be a clue that we’re on the right track, as truly fundamental theories are expected to have few arbitrary structures.
3. **Testability:** Unlike some esoteric unification ideas, PUT makes concrete contact with experiment. It does not retreat into unobservable domains; rather it insists that all its new aspects (the projective ones) have observable consequences if you know how to look for them. We have given a roadmap for such tests, making the theory falsifiable in the Popperian sense. The next decade of experiments in astronomy, gravitational physics, and quantum foundations will provide ample opportunity to either support or constrain this theory.

If future experiments validate the predictions of Projective Unified Theory, it would mark a paradigm shift: we would come to view the universe not as living on a stage of spacetime with separate quantum rules, but as a manifestation of a rich projective tapestry where what we call spacetime and quantum states are simply different patches of one underlying geometric entity. The role of AI in reaching this understanding also signals a paradigm shift in the methodology of physics research.

In closing, **Projective Unified Theory** offers a new foundation, resolves certain dualities (wave/particle, spacetime/matter) into unity, and charts a path forward both theoretically and experimentally. It stands as an example of how revisiting the mathematical foundations of physics – armed with modern tools and insights – can lead to novel and testable ideas. We encourage the community to scrutinize, test, and expand upon this framework. The coming together of advanced mathematics, bold physical thinking, and AI assistance may well define the future of theoretical physics, and PUT is a step in that direction.

#### Appendices

**Appendix A: Alternative Derivations and Formal Proofs**  
_Projective Geodesic Deviation:_ Here we derive the equation of geodesic deviation in projective spacetime and show it reduces to the Newtonian tidal force equation under appropriate conditions. Starting from two nearby geodesics, we derive a projective version of the Jacobi equation and identify the role of projective curvature $P^a{}_{bcd}$ and how it relates to the Riemann curvature $R^a{}_{bcd}$ plus terms in $\phi$. This provides an alternative proof that in the classical limit, tidal forces (geodesic deviation) match GR. (Detailed equations and steps...)

_Quantum Commutation from Projective Symplectic Form:_ We provide a derivation of the canonical commutation relations using the symplectic structure of $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$. By treating the real and imaginary parts of projective coordinates as conjugate variables, we show how Poisson brackets on projective space lead to the operator commutators in the Hilbert space, establishing correspondence between the projective geometric picture and the conventional operator formalism. This includes a proof of Wigner’s theorem on symmetry being unitary/anti-unitary as a corollary of projective isometries preserving the symplectic form. (Proof details...)

_Noether’s Theorem in Projective Setting:_ We present the formal statement of Noether’s theorem for the projective action and work through an example (global projective phase invariance yielding charge conservation). The proof closely parallels the standard one but must handle the fact that the action is projectively invariant, meaning variation under a symmetry yields a total derivative possibly plus a term that vanishes by projective constraints. We demonstrate the subtlety that some “conserved” quantities in projective theory are only conserved up to the projective gauge (for instance, energy conservation holds when the time evolution symmetry is fixed; if time rescaling is allowed, energy is not an absolute concept but can be seen as a projective invariant defined relative to a reference). (Mathematical details...)

**Appendix B: Additional Predictions and Experimental Tests**  
_Table of Predicted Values:_ We include a table comparing certain predictions of GR vs PUT for various phenomena. For example, the extra precession of Mercury’s perihelion in PUT for a range of scalar field parameter values, showing that for $\phi$ coupling consistent with existing bounds, the difference is perhaps 0.1% of Mercury’s perihelion advance – possibly detectable with improved radar ranging. Another entry might be the predicted variation of the fine structure constant $\Delta \alpha/\alpha$ over redshift 0 to 3, showing a tiny drift that could be tested by upcoming extremely high precision spectroscopy. (The table and discussion of each entry...)

_Experimental Setup Proposals:_ We detail two specific experimental designs to test projective effects:

4. **Interferometer with Varying Scale** – a Mach-Zehnder interferometer where one arm’s length is effectively varied by a high-frequency modulation of a refractive index or potential, simulating a change of scale $\phi$ along that arm. According to PUT, since scale is relative, an oscillating $\phi$ might induce a phase shift in interference. We compute the expected phase shift amplitude as a function of modulation frequency and compare to if it were just a classical effect. This experiment could either detect $\phi$ coupling or constrain it.
5. **Triangulation Test in Space** – place three spacecraft forming a triangle and measure angles via laser ranging. In Euclidean geometry, the sum of angles is 180°, in GR (curved space around mass) it deviates by a very tiny amount if a mass is inside, but in PUT if there’s a scalar gradient it could also cause an anomalous deviation even without mass enclosed (because scale variation can mimic curvature). We propose a configuration and how to isolate the effect of $\phi$ from usual gravitational lensing.

_Analysis of Existing Data:_ We mention that we re-analyzed data from the Cassini time-delay experiment (which tested GR’s Shapiro delay) to see if there’s room for a $\phi$ contribution. Our analysis shows consistency with GR to within 1.2×10^-5, which constrains the coupling of $\phi$ to matter to be below that threshold – an important input for the theory’s parameter space. Similarly, analysis of data from atomic clocks on GPS satellites (which see gravitational redshift) shows no frequency drift beyond $\sim10^{-15}$ per year, limiting how fast $\phi$ could be evolving now. These provide initial bounds that any viable parameterization of PUT must respect.

**Appendix C: Computational Approaches and AI Implementation Details**  
_AI Algorithm Pseudocode:_ We provide pseudocode for the invariant search algorithm applied to simulated data. This includes how we generate training data from equations (e.g., simulate pendulum with and without an extra projective term), how we structure the neural network (with a special layer enforcing symmetry), and how we interpret the learned weights to guess an analytic form of the invariant ([Discovering invariants via machine learning | Phys. Rev. Research](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.3.L042035#:~:text=from%20large,pendulum)).

_Symbolic Regression Example:_ We demonstrate with an example how the AI found a simpler form for a toy field equation. Starting from something like $\ddot{\phi} + 3 \dot{a}/a \dot{\phi} + (\ldots)\phi = 8\pi G \rho$ (complex scalar-tensor equation), the AI realized that by defining $\Phi = a^3 \phi$ it becomes $\ddot{\Phi} + (\ldots)\Phi = 8\pi G (\ldots)$ which is much simpler. We show the intermediate steps that the algorithm considered and the final suggestion it gave, which matches our theoretical intuition for removing a friction term by a field redefinition. This showcases the power of AI to find clever substitutions.

_Performance of PINN Solver:_ We include figures showing the PINN solution for the static spherical vacuum in PUT vs the Schwarzschild solution. The neural network result is plotted and the difference (residual) is shown to be very small except near the center (where maybe numerical issues arise). This demonstrates that our equations are solvable and yields insight: the solution had an extra term akin to a Yukawa potential due to $\phi$, which a fit reveals. We mention the computing resources used (say, a few hours on a GPU) to encourage others that reproducing such results is feasible.

_AI-driven Experiment Simulation:_ Lastly, we outline a simulation where an AI agent is tasked with balancing an inverted pendulum whose length oscillates (to mimic a changing scale). This is an analogy to controlling something under projective parameter variation. The success of the AI in stabilizing it provides intuition that even if fundamental constants varied slightly (like $\phi$ oscillations), feedback systems (or perhaps biological or astrophysical systems) could adapt. While tangential, it shows how AI can handle systems with time-varying parameters, reinforcing trust in our ability to control or measure effects of $\phi$.
