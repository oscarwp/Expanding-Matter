# THE COMPLETE THREE‑CIRCLE UNIVERSAL CALCULATOR (PERSONAL WELLNESS EDITION)

_A comprehensive mapping of the Universal Calculator’s three rings and their ten positions—reinterpreted one‑to‑one for personal practice, regulation, relationships, and growth._

---
## -1. How To Use This

1. Paste it into an AI.
2. Tell the AI to repeat the Rules of operation to ensure compliance.
3. Tell the AI what system in your life you would like to address and why (body part? Personal Relationship?) and then ask that it work it through the rules of the UCPE and ask that it shows you the work.
4. After it comes to a conclusion ensure that it fully followed all of the rules of operation and did not skip any.  
5. Then... ???  Maybe try what it determines and let me know if it works?  Also please suggest changes or improvements.

## 0. RULES OF OPERATION: USAGE GUIDE FOR THE PERSONAL UNIVERSAL CALCULATOR

**1) Identify the target domain (Ring Two).**  
Meditation session, energy today, a relationship tension, a habit you want to shift, a life transition.

**2) Locate the current constraint (Ring One).**  
Ask: _What is the geometry right now?_

- Spacey/diffuse (1), pressured (2), on a rail (3), shearing (4), spinning (5), clicking (6), layered (7), locked (8), edge‑issue (9), identity shift (10).
    
**3) Choose the matching interaction (Ring Three).**  
Pick the **smallest** practice pathway that pairs well with the active constraint and the domain you’re in.

**4) Align the rings (mentally “rotate” them).**

- Put the Ring Two item at the top.
    
- Align the Ring One constraint you found.
    
- Align the Ring Three practice that resolves it.
    

**5) Do one tiny move; watch for the transition feel.**  
Typical shift signatures: _soft click, drop, surge/vent, widening, clarity._ (All are valid projections of the same geometric reallocation.)

**6) Record the triad you used.**  
Example: _(2‑2‑2) Regulation triad, 2→7→1 pathway; felt “drop” in chest; better breath; texted partner to move dinner to tomorrow._  
This builds your **personal atlas** of what reliably restores VCR coherence.

**7) Iterate gently.**  
If it didn’t move, either the constraint ID was off by one (e.g., 4 not 9), or the practice was too big. Scale down. Re‑align. Try again. Keep the geometry; change the move.

## RING ONE: FUNDAMENTAL CONSTRAINTS / ACTIONS

_The possibilities that define what your system can do right now.  This is often how one states the 'problem'.  For example:  "I'm feeling like I can't change the situation I'm trying to get out of" might be considered Phase Lock OR something else.  There is always more than one way to consider a problem and it's likely that you'll need to adjust parameters a few times before you arrive at something useful_

## RULES OF OPERATION: USAGE GUIDE FOR THE PERSONAL UNIVERSAL CALCULATOR

**1) Identify the target domain (Ring Two).**  
Meditation session, energy today, a relationship tension, a habit you want to shift, a life transition.

**2) Locate the current constraint (Ring One).**  
Ask: _What is the geometry right now?_

- Spacey/diffuse (1), pressured (2), on a rail (3), shearing (4), spinning (5), clicking (6), layered (7), locked (8), edge‑issue (9), identity shift (10).
    

**3) Choose the matching interaction (Ring Three).**  
Pick the **smallest** practice pathway that pairs well with the active constraint and the domain you’re in.

**4) Align the rings (mentally “rotate” them).**

- Put the Ring Two item at the top.
    
- Align the Ring One constraint you found.
    
- Align the Ring Three practice that resolves it.
    

**5) Do one tiny move; watch for the transition feel.**  
Typical shift signatures: _soft click, drop, surge/vent, widening, clarity._ (All are valid projections of the same geometric reallocation.)

**6) Record the triad you used.**  
Example: _(2‑2‑2) Regulation triad, 2→7→1 pathway; felt “drop” in chest; better breath; texted partner to move dinner to tomorrow._  
This builds your **personal atlas** of what reliably restores VCR coherence.

**7) Iterate gently.**  
If it didn’t move, either the constraint ID was off by one (e.g., 4 not 9), or the practice was too big. Scale down. Re‑align. Try again. Keep the geometry; change the move.

---

## QUICK REFERENCE: RING‑ONE → MICRO‑MOVE (ONE‑BREATH SCALE)

- **1 (Uniform Expansion)** → Choose **one point** to rest attention (anchor for 3 breaths).
    
- **2 (Radial Compression)** → **One outward line**: one honest sentence, one exhale into back body.
    
- **3 (Axial Constraint)** → Add **sideways option**: turn eyes/head; list three alternatives.
    
- **4 (Planar Shear)** → **Name the two planes** and align **one shared edge** (one agreement).
    
- **5 (Torsional Twist)** → **One end holds, one end moves** (ground feet; let hands write/shake).
    
- **6 (Harmonic Resonance)** → **Don’t oversteer**; keep doing _slightly less_ than you can.
    
- **7 (Nested Shells)** → **Soften only the outermost layer** (5% more openness; one tiny routine tweak).
    
- **8 (Phase Lock)** → **Tiny phase shift** (change timing/context/first line).
    
- **9 (Projective Boundary)** → **State the edge** (one clear no/yes/not‑now).
    
- **10 (Recursive Transform)** → **Reduce load**; mark the change (one witness/journal line).

## NOTES ON MEASUREMENT & FEELING (Projective Consistency)

- **Somatic sensations are structural data.** “Flow,” “pull,” “pressure,” “vortex,” “relief,” “settling,” “warmth,” “clarity” are **valid coordinate readings** of the same geometry the math describes.
    
- **No exclusions.** In a universal model, every honest description is a projection of the invariant; we use it, not dismiss it.
    
- **The Calculator is not therapy or diagnosis.** It’s a geometry‑led orientation instrument. Use professional care as needed.
